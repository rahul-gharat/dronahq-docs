# You're Using Codespaces

Look at you go! Since this is running in a devcontainer, we've installed dependencies automatically for you üî•

## The deets

We've installed a few useful extensions for you, too:

- **Prettier** because who formats their own code in this day and age?
- **code-spell-checker** because words are hard.

We hope these additions make contributing a breeze.

## Next steps

In the terminal below, you should see a `postCreateCommand` script running. When it's done, you'll need to run the following command to fire up the dev server:

```bash
cd docs && yarn start --host 0.0.0.0
```

Happy contributing!
