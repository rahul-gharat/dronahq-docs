# Agent Triggers

Agent Triggers define **when and how an AI Agent starts running**.

Think of a trigger as the **entry point** to your agent.
When a trigger fires, your agent wakes up, understands the context, and executes its instructions.

---

## Why Triggers Matter

Triggers allow agents to work **automatically**, without manual effort.

With triggers, agents can:
- Respond to real-time events
- Run on a schedule
- Integrate with external systems
- Communicate directly with users

This makes agents suitable for **automation, support, integrations, and background workflows**.

---

## How Triggers Work (Simple Mental Model)

1. **An event occurs**
   - A message is sent
   - A webhook is called
   - A scheduled time is reached

2. **The trigger activates**
   - Context is created (metadata, payload, user details)

3. **The agent runs**
   - Instructions are applied
   - Tools may be used
   - Decisions are made

4. **Optional output**
   - Message sent back
   - Data processed
   - External systems updated

Each trigger execution is **independent and isolated**.

## Adding Triggers to an Agent

</figure>


An agent can have **one or multiple triggers**.

### Steps to Add a Trigger
1. Open your agent
2. Click **Add Trigger**
3. Select one or more trigger types
4. Click **Add Triggers**

Each selected trigger becomes a **new entry point** to the same agent logic.

## Available Trigger Types

### Chat
Use this trigger for:
- Manual testing
- Internal conversations
- Quick validation during development

---

### Webhook
Use this trigger when:
- An external system needs to start the agent
- Structured data must be sent to the agent

Examples:
- Form submissions
- Payment events
- CRM or backend workflows

---

### Scheduler
Use this trigger when:
- The agent must run automatically at fixed times
- No user interaction is required

- Daily or weekly reports
- Periodic monitoring
- Background maintenance tasks

---

## Coming Soon Triggers 🚧

These triggers are not selectable yet and indicate **upcoming platform capabilities**:

- Instagram
- Messenger
- Slack
- Email

Once released, these triggers can be added to **existing agents** without changing agent logic.

## Which Trigger Should I Use?

Use this quick guide to choose the right trigger:

| Your Requirement | Recommended Trigger |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Run agent automatically at fixed times | Scheduler |
| Start agent from another system | Webhook |
| Talk to users in real time | WhatsApp |
| Test or chat internally | Chat |
| No user interaction required | Scheduler |
| Event-driven integrations | Webhook |

---

## Can an Agent Have Multiple Triggers?

Yes ✅

A single agent can:
- Run on a schedule
- Respond to webhooks
- Chat on WhatsApp

All triggers share the **same agent instructions and tools**.

Think of triggers as **multiple doors leading to the same agent brain**.

---

## Best Practices

- Start with **one trigger** while building
- Add more triggers as your use case grows
- Reuse the same agent instead of creating duplicates
- Use:
  - Scheduler for automation
  - Webhook for integrations
  - WhatsApp for conversations
