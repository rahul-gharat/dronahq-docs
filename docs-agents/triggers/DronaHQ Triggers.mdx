# DronaHQ Triggers

DronaHQ supports **145+ triggers** from major platforms and services. These triggers allow your agents to respond to events from various applications and services automatically.

> **Quick Start**
> 
> 1. Open an agent
> 2. Add a trigger (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.)
> 3. Authenticate once
> 4. Choose the event
> 5. Your agent starts running automatically

## What Are DronaHQ Triggers?

DronaHQ Triggers are **platform-specific integrations** that connect your AI agents directly to popular services like Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, and many more. When an event occurs in one of these platforms, your agent automatically activates and processes the event.

Think of DronaHQ Triggers as **bridges** between your favorite tools and your AI agent. Instead of manually checking for updates or building custom webhooks, these triggers handle the integration for you.

## Why Use DronaHQ Triggers?

DronaHQ Triggers enable **seamless automation** across your entire tech stack:

- **No-code integration**: Connect to 145+ platforms without writing code
- **Real-time automation**: Agents respond instantly to events as they happen
- **Unified workflow**: One agent can monitor multiple platforms simultaneously
- **Easy setup**: Authenticate once and configure event triggers in minutes
- **Reliable delivery**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms

## How DronaHQ Triggers Work

1. **Connect your platform account**
   - Authenticate with the service (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.)
   - Grant necessary permissions

2. **Configure event triggers**
   - Select which events should activate your agent
   - Choose specific conditions or filters

3. **Event occurs in the platform**
   - A new email arrives in Gmail
   - A message is posted in Slack
   - A pull request is created in GitHub
   - Or any other configured event

4. **Your agent activates automatically**
   - Receives the event data as context
   - Executes its instructions
   - Can respond, process data, or trigger other actions

Each trigger execution is **independent and isolated**, ensuring reliable performance even with high event volumes.

---

## Trigger Types: Polling vs Real-Time

DronaHQ triggers use two mechanisms to detect events:

- **Polling triggers**: Check for changes at regular intervals (e.g., every minute, every 5 minutes). These are reliable and work with most platforms, but may have a slight delay between when an event occurs and when your agent is notified.
- **Real-time triggers**: Uses webhooks to receive instant notifications when events occur. These provide immediate responses but require the platform to support webhook callbacks.

DronaHQ automatically manages reliability, retries, and deduplication for both types. The trigger interface will indicate whether a trigger uses polling or real-time mechanisms.

## Adding Triggers to an Agent


<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/agent-trigger/agent-add-dronahq-trigger.png" alt="Add Triggers" width='80%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Add Triggers</i></figcaption>
</figure>


An agent can have **one or multiple triggers**.

### Steps to Add a Trigger
1. Open your agent
2. Click **Add Trigger → DronaHQ Triggers**
3. Select one or more trigger types
4. Click **Add Triggers**

Each selected trigger becomes a **new entry point** to the same agent logic.

---

## Example: Gmail → Slack Automation

Here's a concrete example of how triggers work in practice:

**Scenario**: You want to automatically summarize important emails and post them to a Slack channel.

1. **Set up the Gmail trigger**: Configure "New Gmail Message Received" to monitor your inbox
2. **Configure filters**: Add a query like `from:important@company.com` to only process specific emails
3. **Agent activates**: When a matching email arrives, the trigger fires and passes the email content to your agent
4. **Agent processes**: Your agent (with instructions to summarize emails) reads the email and creates a summary
5. **Agent responds**: The agent posts the summary to your designated Slack channel using a Slack tool

This entire flow happens automatically—no manual intervention needed. The trigger handles the Gmail integration, and your agent handles the logic.

## Limitations

When working with DronaHQ Platform Triggers, please be aware of the following limitations:

### Triggers Cannot Be Edited Once Saved

Once a trigger is configured and saved, **it cannot be edited**. If you need to make changes to a trigger's configuration:

1. Delete the existing trigger
2. Create a new trigger with the updated configuration, or
3. Duplicate the trigger and modify it before saving

This ensures data integrity and prevents conflicts in trigger configurations.

### Duplicate Trigger Restrictions

You **cannot create multiple triggers** with the same account and identical configuration, even across different agents. To create a similar trigger, you must:

- Use a **different account** or
- Use a **different configuration** (e.g., different parameters, filters, or query settings)

This limitation prevents duplicate event processing and ensures each trigger configuration is unique within your DronaHQ workspace.

## Can an Agent Have Multiple Triggers?

Yes ✅

A single agent can:
- Run on a schedule
- Respond to webhooks
- Chat on WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook Messenger
- Monitor Gmail, Outlook, or Slack
- Track GitHub, Jira, or Linear events
- Process Salesforce, HubSpot, or Stripe events
- And much more...

All triggers share the **same agent instructions and tools**.

Think of triggers as **multiple doors leading to the same agent brain**.

---

## Best Practices

- Start with **one trigger** while building
- Add more triggers as your use case grows
- Reuse the same agent instead of creating duplicates
- Use:
  - Scheduler for time-based automation
  - Webhook for custom integrations
  - Platform triggers (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.) for service-specific automation
  - WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger for conversations

---

## What's Next?

Explore individual trigger guides for detailed setup and behavior:

- [Scheduler Trigger](/agents/triggers/inbuilt-triggers/scheduler)
- [Webhook Trigger](/agents/triggers/inbuilt-triggers/webhook)
- [WhatsApp Trigger](/agents/triggers/inbuilt-triggers/whatsapp)
- [Instagram Trigger](/agents/triggers/inbuilt-triggers/instagram)
- [Facebook Messenger Trigger](/agents/triggers/inbuilt-triggers/facebook)

For platform-specific triggers (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, etc.), configure them directly in the trigger selection panel. Each platform trigger follows a similar setup pattern:

1. Select the platform trigger
2. Authenticate with your account
3. Configure which events should trigger your agent
4. Map the event data to your agent context

All platform triggers integrate seamlessly with your agent's instructions and tools.
