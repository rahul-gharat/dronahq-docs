## What Are DronaHQ Agents?
DronaHQ Agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workers that can:
- Use tools (APIs, databases, actions) to get work done
- Follow multi-step plans
- Work with your business data
- Trigger workflows or complete tasks end-to-end
- Integrate into apps, portals, forms, or automations

Agents run in a secure, scalable execution environment and can be connected to apps via UI components, APIs, webhooks, or external systems.

## Key Concepts

#### **1. Agents**
Programmable AI workers capable of planning and performing tasks using tools.

#### **2. Tools**
Actions the agent can call—e.g., database queries, REST APIs, GPT models, DronaHQ actions, automations.

#### **3. Memory**
Store intermediate results, context, or conversation history.

#### **4. Workflows**
Multi-step logic where agents can be embedded as steps.

#### **5. Integrations**
Connect external services like Google Sheets, Gmail, Slack, Connector Libraries, REST APIs.

## ✅ Prerequisites
Before you start:
- A DronaHQ account (sign up if you don't have one)
- Access to **DronaHQ AI Agents**


## Step 1: Create Your First Agent

1. Go to **DronaHQ → Agents**
2. Click **+ Add Agent**
3. Configure the basic properties:
   - Agent Name
   - Agent Description
   - Model (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic)

## Step 2: Add Tools to Your Agent
Tools allow your agent to execute real tasks.
1. Click **+ Add Tools**
2. Choose tools from available list under - DronaHQ Tools, Connector Library, Automations, Code, MCP etc
3. Configure Account for selected tool if not already configured using Edit option -> Add Account (under Environment section).

### Types of Tools
- **DronaHQ Tools** – Ready Integrations to 3rd party services like Gmail, Github, Slack, Notion, Google Sheets etc.
- **Connector Library** – Connectors configured in your Account.
- **Connector Query** – Use and Add Query for Connectors configured in your Account.
- **Automations** (Coming Soon) – Connect with your automations .
- **Code** – Write Python or Javascript code to be executed.
- **MCP** – Integrate with your MCP servers in your account.
- **Agent** (Coming Soon) – write custom logic/functions.
- **Inbuilt Tools** – Inbuilt tools such as Websearch, Time, Calculator.

The agent will now call these tools using natural language instructions.

## Step 3: Configure Instruction
- Write down in details how your agent should execute for the given user instruction describing how the above added tools to be used.
- Add Knowledge Base in case you want to perform RAG operation on Webpages, PDFs or any other Text files.
- Use Keywords in instructions like {{currentuser.email}}, {{currentuser.groups}} etc to personalize the instructions specific to end user.

## Step 4: Test Your Agent
1. Go to **Playground**.
2. Try natural prompts like:
   - "Create a support ticket for user John Doe."
   - "Find orders above $1000 from last week."
3. Inspect:
   - Tool calling sequence
   - Final output
   - Model reasoning

## Step 5: Publish Your Agent
Once you are satisfied with the Agent's working in playground for different prompts, You can publish your Agent. After publish, you can access the Agent as a standalone chatbot, embed in DronaHQ App or your website or integrate in any of your Automation.

## Observability
DronaHQ provides:
- Agent execution logs
- Tool call traces
- Token usage & credit consumption
- Error monitoring

This helps debug and scale your agent workloads.

## Best Practices
- Keep tool schemas well-defined
- Add guardrails & constraints in system prompt
- Break large tasks into multi-step agents
- Use Knowledge Base for RAG or knowledge tasks
- Test each tool independently before connecting

## You're Ready to Build Powerful Agents!
With DronaHQ Agents, you can automate business processes, power internal copilots, and connect AI to real systems with minimal effort.
