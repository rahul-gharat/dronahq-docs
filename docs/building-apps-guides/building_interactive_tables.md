# Building Interactive tables

Tables are a common way to view and interact with your data. You can sort, filter, paginate, and download rows of information. Tables also support row selection and insertion, server-side pagination, and custom columns.


## Load data in a table

When you drag a `Table` component to the Builder screen, it automatically displays data from one of your queries. If you don't have any queries, DronaHQ initially populates the table with test data in JSON format. You can change the data displayed in a table by editing the Data property. `Select control -> Data section` From `Quick Select` you can select a query, use JavaScript (e.g., `data_1`), or input an array.

### Change column types

using format data in data section you can change column type of the data that is binded.
by using different data types you can also set different look and feel for your data.

- **sorting columns** :- using the first 3 dots you can sort the columns as per your requirements.

- **Type Icon** :- this shows a icon according to data type for different columns, it is also a short-cut button to open format data section.

- **Rename columns** :- using this section we can directly rename the headers of the table grid control.

- **Hide/show columns** :- by clicking on the `eye icon` we can hide those columns to be vissble on table grid, but this columns will be available as data for any other refreneces.

## Editable table columns

To edit table data directly inside table grid control.

### Config in property section
After binding data to table grid control, you can make columns `editable` and edit data on run time directly inside that cell.
To do this in `Property section` we have a dropdown **Choose columns that will be editable** you need to choose columns that you want to make editable.

### Config in Events section
After choosing columns that will be editable we have to configure the `save_changes` event of table grid control.
once you edit any cell you will be able to see 2 Buttons `Cancel` and `Save changes`.
- `Cancel` :- on click of cancel button all the changes will be reverted back and bottons will be invisble.
- `Save Changes` :- on click of save changes the flow that is configured in `save_changes` event will be called, so logic to save data to your data source will go here. you can also change the text for this button from **Custom label** property from property section.


To use this feature you need to do a single click on the cell that you wish to edit.

:::info
To view the new data you need to call the Run Data Queries action and refresh the variable that is providing data to table grid.
so this will reload the table and again hide the `cancel` and `Save changes` again.
:::

### Access only edited data
Once data in any of the cell is edited it will be available in the controls **EDITEDROWS** properties as eg :-` {{tablegrid.PROPERTIES.EDITEDROWS}}`.
This will always return an array of objects.

## Add new data to tables

To add new data directly to table grid control.

### Config in Events section

The event of `save_changes` will be used for both Editing as well as adding New data to table grid.
After choosing columns that will be editable in new rows we have to configure the `save_changes` event of table grid control.

In same fashion you can define custom actions for rows that can be made visible at different places like in `seachbar` or as a `new column` or `onHover` based on properties that are configured and define action flow in their respective events. for eg:- `Action1` action flow should be configured in `action1_click`.
