# Building Interactive tables

Tables are a common way to view and interact with your data. You can sort, filter, paginate, and download rows of information. Tables also support row selection and insertion, server-side pagination, and custom columns.


## Load data in a table

When you drag a `Table` component to the Builder screen, it automatically displays data from one of your queries. If you don't have any queries, DronaHQ initially populates the table with test data in JSON format. You can change the data displayed in a table by editing the Data property. `Select control -> Data section` From `Quick Select` you can select a query, use JavaScript (e.g., `data_1`), or input an array.

### Working with columns

  <figcaption align='left'><i>Column options after save and Format Data.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

- **sorting columns** :- using the first 3 dots you can sort the columns as per your requirements.

- **Type Icon** :- this shows a icon according to data type for different columns, it is also a short-cut button to open format data section.

- **Rename columns** :- using this section we can directly rename the headers of the table grid control.

- **Hide/show columns** :- by clicking on the `eye icon` we can hide those columns to be visible on table grid, but this columns will be available as data for any other references.

### Change column types

using format data in data section you can change column type of the data that is binded.
by using different data types you can also set different look and feel for your data.

## Editable table columns

To edit table data directly inside table grid control.

### Config in property section

<figure>
  <Image src="/img/guides/building-interactive-tables/building-interactive-tables-editable-property.png" alt="Simple Database GUI" />
  <figcaption align='left'><i>Configure columns that will be editable.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

After binding data to table grid control, you can make columns `editable` and edit data on run time directly inside that cell.
To do this in `Property section` we have a dropdown **Choose columns that will be editable** you need to choose columns that you want to make editable.

### Config in Events section
After choosing columns that will be editable we have to configure the `save_changes` event of table grid control.
once you edit any cell you will be able to see 2 Buttons `Cancel` and `Save changes`.
- `Cancel` :- on click of cancel button all the changes will be reverted back and buttons will be invisible.
- `Save Changes` :- on click of save changes the flow that is configured in `save_changes` event will be called, so logic to save data to your data source will go here. you can also change the text for this button from **Custom label** property from property section.


To use this feature you need to do a single click on the cell that you wish to edit.

:::info
To view the new data you need to call the Run Data Queries action and refresh the variable that is providing data to table grid.
so this will reload the table and again hide the `cancel` and `Save changes` again.
:::

### Access only edited data
Once data in any of the cell is edited it will be available in the controls **EDITEDROWS** properties as eg :-` {{tablegrid.PROPERTIES.EDITEDROWS}}`.
This will always return an array of objects.

## Add new data to tables

To add new data directly to table grid control.

### Config in property section

<figure>
  <Image src="/img/guides/building-interactive-tables/building-interactive-tables-add-row-property.png" alt="Simple Database GUI" />
  <figcaption align='left'><i>Configure columns that will be editable when new row is added.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Inside property section you have to toggle on **Add new Row** property, this will add a `+ Add Row` button to the bottom of the table.
On click of this button it will add a blank row to table grid with columns that are editable in new row.
To specify `which columns will be editable` in this new row we have to Choose columns in **columns that will be editable in new rows** dropdown in property section.

### Config in Events section
The event of `save_changes` will be used for both Editing as well as adding New data to table grid.
After choosing columns that will be editable in new rows we have to configure the `save_changes` event of table grid control.
same as Editable Table columns.

### Access only edited data
Once data in any of the cell is edited it will be available in the controls **EDITEDROWS** properties as eg :-` {{tablegrid.PROPERTIES.NEWROWS}}`.
This will always return an array of objects.

:::tip
For smooth integration of both the features in single save_changes event you should use branches with respective conditions.

## Toolbar
Top section of table grid can have multiple different utilities with there respective functionality.

1. **Search Bar** :- Search bar can be used to `search for filter records` from the `loaded data` as well as from `server side`.
To enable server side search there is a toggle in property section to enable **Server Side Search**.
2. **Actions** :- this actions are `Add`, `Update`, `Delete` this will be visible in the top bar of table grid along with search bar (if enabled) and on click of this actions what flow will be executed has to be defined in their respective actions `add_click`, `update_click`, `delete_click`.
3. **Download** :- Download action will help user to download the data is loaded in table in `.csv` format, you can also specify name for the file that will be downloaded using **Downloaded File Name** property.
4. **Refresh** :- Refresh action will help user to reload the table data by clicking it, you also configure the refresh action flow to be performed using the `refresh_click` event.
5. **Row Size** :- Row Size property allows you to switch between the row sizes while displaying the data, for this feature there are 3 different values `Small (S)`, `Medium (M)`, `Large (L)`. You can also set default size using **Default Row Size** property.

## Sort, Filter and customize data presentation

To enable sorting in table grid you have to toggle on **Sorting** property this will enable the end user to define the sorting conditions and this will persistent for user so every time user lands on this screen this sorting will also be applied by default.

To enable filters in table grid you have to toggle on **Filters** property this will enable user to provide filter conditions according to data types defined for different columns, it will show different ui for different data types. Also if the data type of a column is set to Single tag then you can enable **Quick Filter** property and select the column that is set to single tag you wish to use for quick filter in **Quick Filter** dropdown and it will show values as tags below the search bar.

this Filters by default persist when you use pagination so you wish to avoid this behavior you can toggle off **Persist Filter** property.

### Customize UI for Table
- `Table Headers:` you can set `Background`, `Font size`, `Font weight`, `Font color` and `Text alignment`.
- `Table Data:` you can set `Font size`, `Font weight` and `Text alignment`.
- `Hide Vertical Lines:` Enable the option to hide vertical lines between table cells for a cleaner appearance.
- `Row Background colors:` you can set different colors for odd and even rows of display them separately.
- `Theme:` you can set a color in `Theme` property and it will be applied to many places where color is applicable.
- `Column Width:` By default, you can specify `Column min width` and `Column max width` in pixels. However, if `Enable custom column width` toggled on, you can provide numeric arrays of widths in sequence to customize column widths dynamically.
- `Checkboxes` you can set checkboxes to `Single select` or `Multi select` or `No` as per your requirements.
- `Detail view` you can show some data in table and enable detail view to show more data, when user clicks on it a sidebar will be shown with all the data. You can also customize this as well using `Show Key Value Map` property and by toggling on `customize` you can choose which columns will be shown on detail view as well.

### Group Data
To use this feature you need to toggle on `Group Data` property, with the help of this property you can group data according to value of one of the columns in the data. To set which columns will be used for grouping needs to be set to `Group By` property and you can set `Accordion Style` property as `All Open`, `All Close`, `First Open` as per your requirements. 

### Column Reorder and Visibility 
To use this feature you need to toggle on **Column Reorder and Visibility** property, with the help of this property end users can change the look and feel of the table for them, they can rearrange columns and also hide or show columns as per there requirements, this will also persist for them so every time they close and open the app that will get same look and feel for table.

### Row selection
To use this feature it is not necessary to have checkbox on in the table grid, on row selection what action flow needs to be executed can be configured in `row_select` event. you can also decide background color for selected row by setting **Selected Row Color** property. You can also configure which row will be by default selected when table is loaded or after refresh by setting **Default Selected Row** property.

### Fit to Screen
To use this feature you need to toggle on `Fit Height To Screen` property, this property enables you to set Height of the Table grid to fit the screen. During pagination, the table fits the screen and you can scroll within the table within the area. also when working with small screen and table grid is not the only control screen the height calculation should not be affected so you can provide a minimum height to **Minimum Height** property this will prevent table grid from unnecessary shrinking in height.

### Aggregation footer

<figure>
  <Image src="/img/guides/building-interactive-tables/building-interactive-tables-aggrigation-footer.png" alt="Simple Database GUI" />
  <figcaption align='center'><i>Aggregation footer in table grid.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

To use this feature you need to toggle on `Show Aggregation Footer` property, this property enables the end users to have some basic calculation operations like `Count all`, `Count values`, `Count unique values`, `Count empty`, `Count not empty` for basic text type columns and `Sum`, `Average`, `Min`, `Max`, `Median`, `Range` for number type columns.

### Pagination

To use this feature, toggle on `Allow` in the pagination group. Your API must support pagination. DronaHQ supports two pagination types: `limit offset-based` and `cursor-based.` Additionally, you can customize the position of the pagination bar by setting the `Pagination Bar Location` property. For connectors that support cursor-based pagination, like Airtable, select `Cursor Based Pagination` as the type and use the OFFSET key from the respective connector.

:::info
To know about implementing pagination in Tablegrid control within DronaHQ, explore the various types: server-side, client-side, and cursor-based. Configure properties such as pagination bar location and default cursor values for optimal performance. Learn how to apply pagination for MySQL, GraphQL, and REST API data sources. For more details, you can read the [Pagination in Tablegrid Control](https://docs.dronahq.com/building-apps-concepts/pagination-in-tablegrid/) article.
:::

### Freeze columns
To use this feature you need to toggle on `Freeze columns` property, this feature enables you to freeze columns when you are scrolling horizontally the number of columns froze will not move from there position.

### Sort and Filter Query

The Filter Query and Sort Query features enable dynamic filtering and sorting of data for both client-side and server-side operations. These functionalities generate outputs in SQL and JSON formats, which can be consumed directly for backend processing or local data manipulation.



#### Filter Query

The Filter Query feature provides users with the ability to define conditions for filtering data. The conditions can be applied server-side or client-side to retrieve only the relevant data rows.

**How It Works:**
1. **User Interaction:**  
   - Users select or input filter criteria through the table grid interface (e.g., "Name equals Vaibhav" and "Age greater than 25").
   
2. **Generated Outputs:**  
   - **SQL Output:** A filter query string that can be sent to a backend for data retrieval.  
     Example:  
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name = 'Vaibhav' AND age > 25;
     ```
   - **JSON Output:** A structured JSON object representing the filter conditions for client-side use.  
     Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Vaibhav",
       "age": { "$gt": 25 }
     }
     ```

3. **Use Case:**  
   - Dynamic data filtering in SQL-based databases or NoSQL environments like MongoDB (with JSON filters).  
   - Adaptable to both server-side and client-side search behavior. 



#### Sort Query

The Sort Query feature allows users to sort table data based on one or more columns, either in ascending or descending order. This can be used for backend processing or client-side table arrangements.


**How It Works:**
1. **User Interaction:**  
   - Users select columns to sort by (e.g., "Sort by Status in Ascending Order" and "Sort by Age in Descending Order").
   
2. **Generated Outputs:**  
   - **SQL Output:** A sort query string that defines the column order for a backend query.  
     Example:  
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY status ASC, age DESC;
     ```
   - **JSON Output:** A structured JSON object for sorting criteria.  
     Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "status": "asc",
       "age": "desc"
     } 
     ```
 ### **Filter Query and Sort Query in Action**

    #### **Filter Query Example**
Imagine a user wants to filter rows where `name` equals "John" and `age` is greater than 25.  
- **SQL Output:**  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John' AND age > 25;
  ```
-    **JSON Output:**  
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": { "$gt": 25 }
  }
  ```

#### **Sort Query Example**
The user wants to sort data by `status` in ascending order and by `age` in descending order.  
- **SQL Output:**  
  ```sql
  ORDER BY status ASC, age DESC;
  ```
- **JSON Output:**  
  ```json
  {
    "status": "asc",
    "age": "desc"
  }
  ```

### **Properties Summary**

| **Property**                       | **Type**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tablegrid.properties.filterquery` | String     | Returns filter conditions as a SQL query string. Example: `name = 'Vaibhav' AND age > 25`.                                                            |
| `tablegrid.properties.filterjson`  | JSON Object| Outputs filter conditions in JSON format for use in client-side or NoSQL environments. Example: `{"name": "Vaibhav", "age": {"$gt": 25}}`.            |
| `tablegrid.properties.sortquery`   | String     | Returns sorting criteria as a SQL query string. Example: `status ASC, age DESC`.                                                                      |
| `tablegrid.properties.sortjson`    | JSON Object| Outputs sorting criteria in JSON format for client-side or NoSQL-based sorting. Example: `{"status": "asc", "age": "desc"}`.                          |

 

## Actions
In Table grid control you can configure different set of actions like `row_select`, `add_click`, `update_click`, `refresh_click`, etc. The First action here is `on Row click`, so what action will be performed on row click like `Select Row` will perform the action flow configured in `row_select` event,`Show Details` will open detail view, `Navigate with Selection` will navigate to screen that is configured.

In same fashion you can define custom actions for rows that can be made visible at different places like in `search bar` or as a `new column` or `onHover` based on properties that are configured and define action flow in their respective events. for eg:- `Action1` action flow should be configured in `action1_click`.
