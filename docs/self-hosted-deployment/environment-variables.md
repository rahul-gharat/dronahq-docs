# Environment Variables

## Overview

Environment variables allow you to configure and customize your **Self-hosted DronaHQ** deployment. These variables control key functionalities, override default settings, and enable optional features. Some features in DronaHQ require specific environment variables to be set for proper operation.

## Best Practices

- **Only set variables when necessary** – Avoid modifying default settings unless required.
- **Restart your instance** after making changes for the variables to take effect.
- **Secure sensitive values** – Store credentials and tokens securely using a vault or secrets management tool.
- Use a **`.env`** file to manage environment variables systematically.

## Configuration

You can define environment variables directly in your shell, within your Docker Compose file, or in a Kubernetes deployment manifest.

### Setting Variables in Shell

```sh
export VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

### Using a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in your deployment directory:

```env
VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

### Defining Variables in Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  webapp:
    environment:
      - VARIABLE_NAME=value
```

### Using Environment Variables in Kubernetes

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: dronahq-webapp
      env:
        - name: VARIABLE_NAME
          value: "value"
```

For a full list of supported environment variables and their descriptions, refer to the official *documentation*.

By properly configuring environment variables, you can optimize the performance, security, and functionality of your **Self-hosted DronaHQ** instance.

## General Environment Variables

These environment variables configure key aspects of **DronaHQ Self-Hosted** deployments.

#### `BUILDER_URL` (Recommended)

Defines the base URL for accessing the **Creator Portal**, **End-User Portal**, user invitations, password resets, and callback URLs for protected resources.

###### Example:
```sh
BUILDER_URL=https://dronahq.example.com
```
If unset, DronaHQ automatically determines the base URL from your machine's local configuration.

###### Default (Localhost Example):
```sh
BUILDER_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

> **Alternative Approach:** You can use `DOMAIN` and `SECURE_HTTP` variables instead of `BUILDER_URL`.

#### `DOMAIN` (Alternative to `BUILDER_URL`)

Defines the domain name of your **DronaHQ Self-Hosted** instance. Use this when not specifying `BUILDER_URL`.

###### Example:
```sh
DOMAIN=dronahq.example.com
```

#### `SECURE_HTTP` (Alternative to `BUILDER_URL`)

Determines whether DronaHQ should use **HTTPS**. This setting is only required if `BUILDER_URL` is not used.

- If set to `true`, DronaHQ uses **HTTPS**.
- If set to `false` or unset, DronaHQ defaults to **HTTP**.

###### Example:
```sh
SECURE_HTTP=true
```

> If you disable HTTPS (`SECURE_HTTP=false`), some features requiring SSL may not function properly.

#### `PATHNAME` (Optional – Use for Sub-Path Deployments)

If DronaHQ is deployed on a **sub-path** rather than the root domain, specify the path using this variable.

###### Example Scenario:
Your instance is accessible at:
```
https://dronahq.example.com/studio
```
Set the `PATHNAME` as follows:
```sh
PATHNAME=/studio
```

> Use this only if you are serving DronaHQ behind a custom web server that modifies the base path.

## Licensing and Activation

#### `LICENSE_KEY`
This is a unique key assigned to you by DronaHQ for activating your self-hosted installation. You can retrieve your **LICENSE_KEY** by logging into the [Self-Hosted Portal](https://studio.dronahq.com/selfhosted/login).

```sh
LICENSE_KEY=<your-unique-license-key>
```

#### `DRONAHQ_LICENSE_URL` (Optional)
For activation and licensing, your **Self-Hosted DronaHQ** instance needs to communicate with DronaHQ’s licensing server. The licensing server is hosted at `license.dronahq.com`, with a public IP address of `52.203.193.48`.

- If your instance is running in a **closed intranet environment**, ensure that `license.dronahq.com` is whitelisted for outbound traffic.
- If direct access is restricted, you can set up a **proxy server** and configure this variable to point to your proxy’s URL.

```sh
DRONAHQ_LICENSE_URL=https://license.dronahq.com
```

> **Best Practice:** If operating behind a corporate firewall or VPN, consult your network administrator to configure the appropriate firewall rules or proxy settings for uninterrupted licensing communication.

## Connectivity to MySQL

Configure the database credentials for your **DronaHQ Self-Hosted** instance. This database stores essential metadata and resources required for application building.

#### `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

- If using a **Docker container** for MySQL, set the following variables:

    ```sh
    MYSQL_HOST=dronahq-self-hosted-mysqldb
    MYSQL_USER=<application-user>
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>
    MYSQL_PORT=3306
    ```

- If using **AWS RDS or another managed MySQL service**, set the values accordingly:

    ```sh
    MYSQL_HOST=<your-rds-endpoint>
    MYSQL_USER=<application-user>
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>
    MYSQL_PORT=3306
    ```

## Connectivity to MongoDB

Configure MongoDB settings for your **DronaHQ Self-Hosted** instance. MongoDB is used to store application data and configurations.

#### `MONGODB_HOST`, `MONGODB_PORT`, `MONGODB_USER`, `MONGODB_PASSWORD`

- If using a **Docker container** for MongoDB, set the following variables:

    ```sh
    MONGODB_HOST=dronahq-self-hosted-mongodb
    MONGODB_USER=<application-user>
    MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password>
    MONGODB_PORT=27017
    ```

- If using **AWS DocumentDB or another managed MongoDB service**, set the values accordingly:

    ```sh
    MONGODB_HOST=<your-mongodb-endpoint>
    MONGODB_USER=<application-user>
    MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password>
    MONGODB_PORT=27017
    ```

#### `MONGODB_ENCODE_CREDENTIALS`

If your MongoDB credentials contain special characters, enable credential encoding:

```sh
MONGODB_ENCODE_CREDENTIALS=true
```

#### `MONGODB_PROTOCOL`

Defines the MongoDB connection protocol:

- Use `mongodb` for standard installations (default).
- Use `mongodb+srv` for **clustered or replica set** configurations.

```sh
MONGODB_PROTOCOL=mongodb
```

#### `MONGODB_PARAMS`

Additional MongoDB parameters can be specified using **URL search parameter format**. Example:

```sh
MONGODB_PARAMS=ssl=true&retryWrites=false
```

#### `MONGODB_TLS`

Enable TLS for a **secure connection** to MongoDB:

```sh
MONGODB_TLS=true
```

#### `MONGODB_CA_CERT_DIR`

If MongoDB uses **TLS authentication**, specify the **certificate authority (CA) bundle** path:

```sh
MONGODB_CA_CERT_DIR=/private/global.bundle.pem
```

#### `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`

Instead of defining separate environment variables, you can provide a **single connection string**:

```sh
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://username:password@prod.mongodb.domain.com?ssl=true&retryWrites=false
```

## File Repository

DronaHQ requires file storage to manage uploaded files from apps and store resources used in applications. Additionally, when an application is published, DronaHQ compresses the application files and serves them from the same repository.

DronaHQ supports multiple options for storing files:

- `repository`: Uses the built-in local file repository
- `aws`: Uses AWS S3 for file storage
- `azure`: Uses Azure Storage Container for file storage
- `gcloud`: Uses Google Cloud Storage for file storage

If this variable is unset, the built-in local file repository (`repository`) will be used by default.

```sh
FILE_UPLOAD_TYPE=repository
```

### Local File Repository Configurations

To use DronaHQ's managed file repository, set `FILE_UPLOAD_TYPE` to `repository` in your environment variables.

```sh
FILE_UPLOAD_TYPE=repository
```

#### `FILEREPOSITORY_STORAGE_LOCATION`

Defines the storage location for files. By default, this is set to the working directory of your installation. You can configure this location as needed.

```sh
FILEREPOSITORY_STORAGE_LOCATION=/path/to/storage/directory
```

#### `FILEREPOSITORY_STORAGE_PREFIX`

Specifies a prefix (folder name) that will be created inside the `FILEREPOSITORY_STORAGE_LOCATION` directory to organize stored files.

```sh
FILEREPOSITORY_STORAGE_PREFIX=files
```

### Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Configuration

You can use Amazon S3 as a file storage solution with DronaHQ. DronaHQ will upload user-uploaded files and other resources to S3. Additionally, published applications will be served from AWS S3. Ensure that the required permissions and policies are set for your bucket so files can be accessed in the browser.

To enable Amazon S3 as the file storage provider, set the following environment variable:

```
FILE_UPLOAD_TYPE=aws
```

#### `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`
Specifies the S3 bucket where files will be stored.

#### `AWS_S3_REGION`
Defines the AWS region where the S3 bucket is hosted or created.

#### `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
These credentials (`AccessKeyId` and `AccessKeySecret`) are required for accessing your S3 bucket and the objects within it. It is recommended to grant full read/write access to this key pair for seamless file management.

#### `AWS_IAM_ROLE_ACCESS`
You can grant S3 bucket access to your instance by assigning an AWS IAM Role. This allows keyless access to your bucket from the instance without exposing credentials.

To enable IAM role-based access, set the following variable in your environment and ensure the correct IAM role is assigned to your instance:

```
AWS_IAM_ROLE_ACCESS=true
```

#### `AWS_S3_ACL`
By default, DronaHQ uses S3 buckets with ACL enabled. If you want to disable ACL, set this variable to `false`.

```
AWS_S3_ACL=false
```

#### `AWS_S3_BUCKET_PROXY_URL`
If you prefer to keep your S3 bucket private, you can set up an authentication middleware (e.g., AWS CloudFront) or another proxy service and provide its URL in this variable.

```
AWS_S3_BUCKET_PROXY_URL=https://dronahq.example-proxy.com
```

### Azure Storage Container Configuration

You can use an **Azure Storage Container** as a file storage solution with DronaHQ. DronaHQ will store uploaded files, application resources, and published applications in the container.

To use Azure Storage Container, set the following environment variable:

```sh
FILE_UPLOAD_TYPE=azure
```

#### `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`
This is your Azure storage account name where your storage container is created.

#### `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
This is a secret key for your storage account. This key must have the necessary permissions to read and write inside your storage container.

#### `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME`
This is the container where DronaHQ will upload application resources and user files. This container will also serve some resources for your applications.

### Google Cloud Storage Configuration

You can use **Google Cloud Storage** as a file storage solution with DronaHQ. DronaHQ will store uploaded files, application resources, and published applications in the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

To use Google Cloud Storage, set the following environment variable:

```sh
FILE_UPLOAD_TYPE=gcloud
```

#### `GCLOUD_STORAGE_PROJECT_ID`
This is the ID of your Google Cloud project where your storage bucket is created.

#### `GCLOUD_STORAGE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE_PATH`
This is the file path (inside your container or mapped volume) of your Google Cloud service account key. This key must have the required permissions to read and write inside your storage bucket.

#### `GCLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`
This is the storage bucket where DronaHQ will upload application resources and user files. This bucket will also serve some resources for your applications.

## Automation

#### `AUTOMATION_LOGGING_CHARACTER_LIMIT`

This variable allows you to set the character limit for automation's [custom task logging](/automations/run-logs/#custom-task-logging). By default, the character limit is set to `300` characters. You can customize this limit as per your requirement. for unlimited characters, set it to `0`.

```shell
    AUTOMATION_LOGGING_CHARACTER_LIMIT=300
```

To streamline automation tasks on AWS, you'll be leveraging two core AWS services: [`Lambda`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [`EventBridge`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). Before initiating any automation procedures, ensure the correct configuration of the following environment variables:
```shell
    RUN_AUTOMATION_ON_AWS=true
```
To interact with Lambda and EventBridge seamlessly, you need to set up the appropriate credentials:

#### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`
These are essential for accessing your Lambda functions and EventBridge scheduler. It's advisable to grant complete read/write access to the scheduler using these credentials..

#### `AWS_REGION`
Specify the AWS region where your Lambda functions and EventBridge scheduler are hosted or deployed.

### AWS Lambda Configuration
Configure the following variables related to AWS Lambda:

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_LAMBDA_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (optional)
You have the option to provide a specific **AccessKeyId** for Lambda, If not provided, the [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`](#aws_access_key_id-aws_access_key_secret) will be utilized.

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_LAMBDA_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (optional)
You have the option to provide a specific **SecretAccessKey** for Lambda, If not provided, the [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`](#aws_access_key_id-aws_access_key_secret) will be utilized.

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_LAMBDA_REGION` (optional)
You have the option to provide a specific **Region** for Lambda, If not provided, the [`AWS_REGION`](#aws_region) will be utilized.


#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`
This denotes the name of your Lambda function.

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN`
This represents the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your Lambda function, which is crucial for triggering automation tasks within Lambda.

#### `AUTOMATION_API_KEY`
This API key facilitates communication between AWS Lambda and DronaHQ Automation. You can assign a custom secret to this variable. Ensure the same secret is provided in the AWS Lambda environment variables. To configure, navigate to `AWS Lambda` > `Functions` > `<function_name>` > `Configuration` > `Environment variables`. For detailed instructions, refer to the screenshot below (Figure: AWS Lambda Environment variable settings).
#### `BUILDER_URL`
This URL points to your DronaHQ Instances, facilitating communication between AWS Lambda and DronaHQ Automation. It should be added to the AWS Lambda environment variables. For setup guidance, refer to the screenshot below (Figure: AWS Lambda Environment variable settings).

### AWS EventBridge (Scheduler) Configuration
Configure the following variable related to AWS EventBridge:

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_SCHEDULER_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (optional)
You have the option to provide a specific **AccessKeyId** for EventBridge, If not provided, the [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`](#aws_access_key_id-aws_access_key_secret) will be utilized.

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_SCHEDULER_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (optional) 
You have the option to provide a specific **SecretAccessKey** for EventBridge, If not provided, the [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`](#aws_access_key_id-aws_access_key_secret) will be utilized.

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_SCHEDULER_REGION` (optional)
You have the option to provide a specific **Region** for EventBridge, If not provided, the [`AWS_REGION`](#aws_region) will be utilized.

#### `AUTOMATION_AWS_SCHEDULER_LAMBDA_EXECUTE_ROLE_ARN`
This denotes the Role ARN of your Lambda function, utilized by EventBridge to trigger automation tasks. Ensure appropriate permissions are granted to this role for seamless execution.

## [MYSQL Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)

When you start the mysql image, you can adjust the configuration of the MySQL instance by passing one or more environment variables on the docker run command line. Do note that none of the variables below will have any effect if you start the container with a data directory that already contains a database: any pre-existing database will always be left untouched on container startup.

See also https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/environment-variables.html for documentation of environment variables which MySQL itself respects (especially variables like MYSQL_HOST, which is known to cause issues when used with this image).

#### `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`
This variable is mandatory and specifies the password that will be set for the MySQL root superuser account. In the above example, it was set to my-secret-pw.

#### `MYSQL_DATABASE`
This variable is optional and allows you to specify the name of a database to be created on image startup. If a user/password was supplied (see below) then that user will be granted superuser access (corresponding to GRANT ALL) to this database.

#### `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
These variables are optional, used in conjunction to create a new user and to set that user's password. This user will be granted superuser permissions (see above) for the database specified by the MYSQL_DATABASE variable. Both variables are required for a user to be created.

Do note that there is no need to use this mechanism to create the root superuser, that user gets created by default with the password specified by the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD variable.

#### `MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD`
This is an optional variable. Set to a non-empty value, like yes, to allow the container to be started with a blank password for the root user. NOTE: Setting this variable to yes is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing, since this will leave your MySQL instance completely unprotected, allowing anyone to gain complete superuser access.

#### `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`
This is an optional variable. Set to a non-empty value, like yes, to generate a random initial password for the root user (using pwgen). The generated root password will be printed to stdout (GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: .....).

#### `MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD`
Sets root (not the user specified in MYSQL_USER!) user as expired once init is complete, forcing a password change on first login. Any non-empty value will activate this setting. NOTE: This feature is supported on MySQL 5.6+ only. Using this option on MySQL 5.5 will throw an appropriate error during initialization.

#### `MYSQL_INITDB_SKIP_TZINFO`
By default, the entrypoint script automatically loads the timezone data needed for the CONVERT_TZ() function. If it is not needed, any non-empty value disables timezone loading.


## [MongoDB Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)
When you start the `mongo` image, you can adjust the initialization of the MongoDB instance by passing one or more environment variables on the `docker run` command line. Do note that none of the variables below will have any effect if you start the container with a data directory that already contains a database: any pre-existing database will always be left untouched on container startup.

#### `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME`, `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
These variables, used in conjunction, create a new user and set that user's password. This user is created in the admin authentication database and given the role of root, which is a "superuser" role.

The following is an example of using these two variables to create a MongoDB instance and then using the mongosh cli (use mongo with 4.x versions) to connect against the admin authentication database.

```shell
    $ docker run -d --network some-network --name some-mongo \
        -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mongoadmin \
        -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
        mongo

    $ docker run -it --rm --network some-network mongo \
        mongosh --host some-mongo \
            -u mongoadmin \
            -p secret \
            --authenticationDatabase admin \
            some-db
    > db.getName();
    some-db
```

Both variables are required for a user to be created. If both are present then MongoDB will start with authentication enabled (mongod --auth).

Authentication in MongoDB is fairly complex, so more complex user setup is explicitly left to the user via /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ (see the Initializing a fresh instance and Authentication sections below for more details).

#### `MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE`
This variable allows you to specify the name of a database to be used for creation scripts in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.js (see Initializing a fresh instance below). MongoDB is fundamentally designed for "create on first use", so if you do not insert data with your JavaScript files, then no database is created.

#### `MONGO_INITDB_USER`, `MONGO_INITDB_PWD`
These are custom variables added by DronaHQ. This will create application user in your database while initializing MongoDB container.
DronaHQ runs following script while initializing container to create application users and and assign read/write access to them.
```shell
    db.createUser({
        user: '$MONGO_INITDB_USER',
        pwd: '$MONGO_INITDB_PWD',
        roles: [{
            role: "userAdminAnyDatabase",
            db: "admin"
        }, {
            role: 'readWrite',
            db: '<% database name %>'
        }]
    })
```
## Global GIT Sync configuration

    GIT_SYNC_IS_LOCK_APP_EDIT=false

#### GIT_SYNC_CREATE_REPO_ON_APP_ADD

Enable this to automatically add new apps to git. Ideally, you should set to `true` for your development instance if you want all apps to be automatically added to git and set it to `false` for your production instance. By default, it is set to `false`.

    GIT_SYNC_CREATE_REPO_ON_APP_ADD=true

## Other optional variables

#### `SECRET_API_TOKEN_KEY`
By default, DronaHQ uses its own secret token for authentication of internal APIs. You can add your custom token instead.

```shell
SECRET_API_TOKEN_KEY=some-random-secret-token
```

#### `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
By default, DronaHQ user its own encryption key to encrypt credentials and secret information flows in system. You can configure your own encryption key for added security. Also make sure to keep backup of your key at secure location.
```shell
