# Billing

Billing for DronaHQ organizations operates on the following parameters:

- Your organization's chosen billing plan.
- The number of users.
- Billing cycle - monthly or annual billing.
- Opt-in Add-ons.

DronaHQ presents a range of tiered, per-user billing plans designed to accommodate organizations of all sizes. Simply select the plan that aligns with your specific requirements, and you will be billed accordingly on a monthly or annual basis, depending on your preference.

To manage your organization's billing, including plan selection and adjustments, you can access the `Billing` settings within your DronaHQ account. This centralized location allows you to conveniently view and switch between available plans and add more users, ensuring flexibility and ease of use. 

At DronaHQ, we understand the importance of providing transparent and tailored billing options to our valued users. By offering scalable plans and intuitive billing management, we aim to support your organization's growth and enable a seamless user experience.

Any upgrade of plans or addition of users, depending on the billing cycle (monthly/annual) will be charged on a pro-rata basis. Every Add-on will have its own different billing cycle and invoicing.
