## Screens

Studio offers a diverse range of screen options, each broadly classified into two types. By providing multiple types of screens, Studio ensures that customers have a variety of choices to suit their specific needs. Following are the two broad classifications of screens

- Freeflow Editor
- Advance Editor

The Freeflow Editor screen enables users to place and resize controls in a grid-like structure, leading to the creation of interactive and pixel-perfect UI designs.

Advance Editor uses a layout control system to precisely arrange controls in relation to each other, providing complete screen layout control.
