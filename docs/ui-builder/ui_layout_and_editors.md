# UI Layout & editors

Studio offers two distinct types of screen editors: the `Freeflow Editor` and the `Advanced Editor`. By default, any new screen created in the studio is set to the Freeflow Editor mode. However, users have the flexibility to choose which screen editor they want to use for each screen they are working on.

You can switch between Advance Editor Mode and Freeflow Editor Mode only when there are no controls placed inside the screen. The button to switch between the modes can be found at the bottom of the screen.
