# UI Layout & editors

DronaHQ offers two distinct types of screen editors: the `Freeflow Editor` and the `Advanced Editor`. By default, any new screen created in the DronaHQ is set to the Freeflow Editor mode. However, users have the flexibility to choose which screen editor they want to use for each screen they are working on.

:::info Info

You can switch between Advance Editor Mode and Freeflow Editor Mode only when there are no controls placed inside the screen. The button to switch between the modes can be found at the bottom of the screen.

## Freeflow Editor

The Freeflow Editor provides users with a straightforward approach to designing screens. Controls can be placed on the screen in a grid-like fashion, making it easy to align and position elements precisely. The editor's grid is composed of 24 columns, enabling users to create responsive and organized layouts. Each row has a fixed height of 10 pixels, maintaining consistency throughout the design.

#### Key Features:
