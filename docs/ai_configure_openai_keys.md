# Configure OpenAI keys 

DronaHQ offers a comprehensive suite of `built-in OpenAI tools` that enable you to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence in your app development activities. With these integrated tools, you can effortlessly `write SQL queries` while seamlessly incorporating connectors, `compose JavaScript code` to bind formulas to Data Queries or JS Blocks within the Action Flow. This streamlined approach ensures a pleasant and hassle-free app-building experience.

To utilize these powerful capabilities, it is essential to configure the OpenAI secret key within the DronaHQ studio. Rest assured, we prioritize the security of your data. The secret key is encrypted before being stored in our system, guaranteeing its safekeeping. Furthermore, we have implemented an additional layer of security by ensuring that the Secret Key is never fetched to the end user system, further enhancing the overall protection of your valuable information.
