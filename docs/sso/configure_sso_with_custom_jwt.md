# Configuring SSO with custom JWT

For configuring Configuring SSO, you will need your [Custom Login info](#setting-up-custom-jwt-login-page), you can then follow below steps for Add JWT based Custom Login in DronaHQ.

Go to `Manage Users -> SSO Configuration -> Select JWT - Custom Login` Option.

Enter form with below fields -

 | Field | Description  | 
  | ----------------- |---------------- |
| Name            | Provide Friendly Name of this SSO configuration  |
| Login URL / SSO URL | Enter `Login URL / SSO URL` from your SAML SSO provider metadata file. |
| Restricted Domain           | Enter domain name for which you want your users to login with for this SSO Configuration. eg - `domain1.com`. DronaHQ will automatically redirect to SSO Login url when we encounter any userâ€™s sign in request with an `email id` belonging to the given restricted domain. |
| SignIn URL | Enter `SignIn URL` of your Custom SSO Login page. |
| Redirect URL | Enter Redirect URL that will set JWT token and call `DronaHQ SDK` for Sign In to DronaHQ Container. If this logic is setup in Sign In URL then use same Sign In URL as Redirect URL. For More details, refer [Setting up JWT Custom Login page](#setting-up-custom-jwt-login-page). |
| Enable JIT user provisioning | Just in time (JIT) user provisioning enables DronaHQ to provision user accounts when users sign in via SSO for the `first time`. This means you won't have to manually invite each user to DronaHQ first. |

:::tip TIP

- Enable JIT user provisioning toggle to automatically add new users provisioned by SSO into DronaHQ.
- You can have same SignIn URL and Redirect URL if both login and setting of JWT token is performed by same endpoint.

:::


### Steps
1. Fill above form.
1. Once, above form is filled, click on `Save to draft` option to save your SSO Configuration.
1. You will be able to view your recently saved SSO configuration in the list. You can click on `Test SSO` button and it will open SSO Login url in a popup. Once you login successfully and if everything is set up correctly, then finally you will see a success message at the bottom.
1. Now, that testing is successful, you can click on the `more option` for above SSO configuration and click on `Activate` to make it live.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Activate SSO</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Once live, all your users belonging to above given domain will be redirected to your SSO login from both the `End User Portal` and `Creator Portal`.

:::caution NOTE

You can have multiple SSO configuration at the same time but it should have different Restricted Domain.

## Setting up Custom JWT Login Page
DronaHQ offers a flexible solution for implementing a custom login system, leveraging your existing backend APIs. Simply create your own login page and connect it to your REST API to enable seamless authorization of login information.

### What you need

1. A web login page (.html, .aspx, .php, etc)
1. Javascript code to have AJAX request to your REST API & wait for its response
1. A middleware REST API to authorize the login information in your system & set JWT token if the user is valid
1. DronaHQ JS in your web login page

#### Sample Demo
For instance, let's consider the scenario where a user is required to enter their login ID and password on a login page. Once the user clicks on the login button, the login information is authenticated by consuming a REST API.

### Step 1. Create Login Screen

Below is Sample Login UI.

Take a note of above `Login URL` that will be required to be added in DronaHQ JWT Custom Auth Configuration.

### Step 2. Call your LoginUser Api

On click of a button, you may have below code implemented to consume the AuthorizeUser REST API.

</figure>

### Step 3. Backend Validate User and Generate JWT Token Response

On the Backend -

To validate the `login ID` and `password`, you can leverage RestSharp or database connectors to seamlessly communicate with your system. Upon successful validation, we can proceed to generate a JWT token to enable secure access to your system.

```csharp
[Route("api/AuthorizeUser"), HttpPost]
public IHttpActionResult DoLoginWork(Payload payload)
{
        // step 1: validate bearer token, if any
        // step 2: fetch the necessary information from the payload
        // validate it with your systems


        // generate JWT token
        if (isValid)
                {
                        obj.status = 200;
                        obj.message = "valid user";


                        //JWT Token for Mobile
                        var jwtheaders = new Dictionary<string, object>()
                                {
                                        { "typ", "JWT" },
                                        { "alg", "SHA256" }
                                };
                        var payload = new Dictionary<string, object>()
                                {
                                        { "iss", DHQ_JWT_KEY },
                                        { "user_email", userEmail },
                                        { "user_name", userName },
                                        { "claims", obj }
                                };


                        byte[] key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(DHQ_JWT_SECRET);
                        obj.token = Jose.JWT.Encode(payload, key, JwsAlgorithm.HS256, jwtheaders);                                        


                }
       
        apiResponse = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj);
        return Ok(apiResponse);
}
```

To obtain the `DHQ_JWT_KEY` and `DHQ_JWT_SECRET`, in DronaHQ Studio, Go to `Manage Users -> SSO Configuration -> Select JWT - Custom Login` Option and Locate `DronaHQ SecretKey` and `DronaHQ SecretID` respectively.
<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/sso/sso-custom-secret-keys.png" alt="DronaHQ SecretKey and SecretID" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>DronaHQ SecretKey and SecretID</i></figcaption>
</figure>

These keys will allow you to securely generate and validate JWT tokens for seamless authentication within your system.

:::info NOTE

Everytime you open this New Configuration page, a new Secret Key and ID will be generated.

### Step 4. Use DronaHQ.js SDK to Login User in DronaHQ Container App

Once you are now through with the API response, on the frontend side we will parse the response.

#### Pre-requisite 
- You must import dronahq.js in your Login HTML or if you are re-directing user to different URL then import it in that HTML page.

Latest `DronaHQ JS SDK v7.3.3` is available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BBHHcPBSKISWOqsxOXFkOg2uZolvmH3R/view?usp=drive_link). 

For future DronaHQ JS SDK releases for versions greater than v7.3.3  - refer [this link](https://github.com/dronahq/dronahq.js/releases)

Take a note of above `Redirect URL` that will be required to be added in DronaHQ JWT Custom Auth Configuration. If this logic is added on same Login HTML then `Redirect UR`L and `SignIn URL` will be same.


```js
var fnSuccess = function(apiResponse){
       
        var jsonApiResponse = JSON.parse(apiResponse);
        if(jsonApiResponse.status == "202"){
            hideButtonLoader();
            swal("Error", jsonApiResponse.message, "warning");
        }
        else{
            var token = jsonApiResponse.token;
            if(DronaHQ.user){
                var userCookie = window.btoa(token);
                DronaHQ.user.setLoginDetails(fnSuccess, fnError, userCookie);
            }
            else{
                if (window.opener) {
                    pm({
                        target: window.opener,
                        type: 'provider_login',
                        data: { token: token }
                    });
                }
            }
        }
    }
    var fnError = function(apiResponse){
        hideButtonLoader();
        swal("Error", "Invalid Login", "error");
    }
```

In the above code, On success we are calling `DronaHQ.user.setLoginDetails(fnSuccess, fnError, userCookie); ` which is a `DronaHQ.js` sdk method and `userCookie` is the JWT Token sent by your backend server. This will log user into the DronaHQ Container app.
