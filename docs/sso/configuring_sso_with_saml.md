# Configuring SSO with SAML

## Prerequisites

To set up SAML SSO in DronaHQ, you will need:

1. SAML Metadata configuration from your SAML SSO provider. This configuration will include - 
    1. Entity ID
    1. Login URL / SSO URL
    1. X509 public certificate info
    1. Binding type
1. SAML Configuration setup at your SSO provider's portal with DronaHQ details. DronaHQ `Entity ID and Metadata URL` and `Redirect URL` can be located at  `Manage Users -> SSO CONFIGURATION -> + Add SSO -> SAML 2.0`.

:::info PLEASE NOTE

Ensure you understand how your SSO provider formats user attributes in received claim, as DronaHQ decodes these tokens as JWTs. You must provide DronaHQ with the corresponding path in the decoded JWT that contains the user's information.

:::

### Adding SSO Configuration

For setting up SAML SSO in DronaHQ, Go to `Manage Users -> SSO CONFIGURATION -> + Add SSO -> SAML 2.0`

Enter form with below fields -

 | Field | Description  | 
  | ----------------- |---------------- |
| Name            | Provide Friendly Name of this SSO configuration  |
| Entity ID              | Enter `Entity ID` from your SAML SSO provider metadata file. Metadata file is an XML file that you can usually locate on your SAML SSO provider dashboard. Additionally, you can often find this data by navigating to `https://<Your Identity Provider URL>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`.|
| Login URL / SSO URL | Enter `Login URL / SSO URL` from your SAML SSO provider metadata file. |
| X509 public certificate      | X509Certificate file in `.cer` format. Refer [here](#creating-x509-public-certificate) for more information on creating this file
| Binding type | Supported Binding type can be either `HTTP POST`, `HTTP Redirect` or `HTTP Redirect`. You can get it from your SAML SSO provider metadata file. |
| Restricted Domain           | Enter domain name for which you want your users to login with for this SSO Configuration. You can add multiple domain names as well. eg - `domain1.com , domain2.com`. DronaHQ will automatically redirect to SSO url when we encounter any user’s sign in request with an email id belonging to the given restricted domain. |
| Want Auth request signed |  It refers to digitally signing the AuthnRequest message when enabled. Digital signing adds a layer of security and ensures the integrity and authenticity of the message. |
| Add Claim List | You can map your `User's ID, Name, Email and Group` with corresponding values in DronaHQ. Here, you need to provide exact path of corresponding key present in SAML assertion received from your SSO provider. For eg - Add `email` to map against `DHQ User Email`, this will refer to `email` key present in `SAML Assertion`.|
| Enable JIT user provisioning | Just in time (JIT) user provisioning enables DronaHQ to provision user accounts when users sign in via SSO for the `first time`. This means you won't have to manually invite each user to DronaHQ first. |
| Enable SCIM User Provisioning | Enable this in case you want to create, update and deactivate User accounts at your SAML provider portal and sync it with DronaHQ user managemnt. Once enabled, you can Configure `DronaHQ SCIM API URL` and `Authenticate` the requests using given `Bearer Token` at your SSO provider's portal. For more info [refer this](./scim_user_provisioning.md)  |

:::tip TIP

- Enable JIT user provisioning toggle to automatically add new users provisioned by SSO into DronaHQ
- Map group name to provide restricted access of the App to the specific group of end users. For Example, you may want to restrict the Finance related Apps to your Finance team members in your organization and HR specific apps to your HR Team in your organization and so on. By default all users will be mapped to the Default group in DronaHQ.
- If user's group is mapped with DronaHQ Group, and at time of user login, if its group name doesn't exists then DronaHQ will create a new group with same name and map it with this user.

### Steps
1. Setup SAML configuration similar to above, at your SAML SSO provider's portal.
1. Fill the above form.
1. Once, the form is filled, click on `Save to draft` option to save your SSO Configuration.
1. You will be able to view your recently saved SSO configuration in the list. You can click on `Test SSO` button and it will open SSO Login url in a popup. Once you login successfully and if everything is set up correctly, then finally you will see a success message at the bottom.
1. Now, that testing is successful, you can click on the `more option` for above SSO configuration and click on `Activate` to make it live.

</figure>

Once live, all your users belonging to above given domain will be redirected to your SSO login from both the `End User Portal` and `Creator Portal`.


## Creating X509 public certificate
Locate `X509Certificate` in your  SAML SSO provider `metadata` file. Create a new file with name ending with `.cer` extension with its content in below format

1. Insert `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` to the beginning of the file .
1. Add `X509Certificate` value from metadata file.
1. Append `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` to the end of the file. For example: 
    ``` 
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIICPTCCAassjdTSEAgIGAUIAVrpxMA0G
    ......
    96sa3ZdjPPASWFasd8l6ZW86yLAECUXQ==
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```
1. Save it and is ready to upload in `X509 public certificate` section

## Conclusion

With SAML (SSO) integration in DronaHQ, users can login into DronaHQ using a single set of login credentials. 

With SCIM User Provisioning, User accounts can be created, updated, and deactivated centrally, ensuring efficient administration across all connected applications.
