# Organizational access

Now that you have a working app which is ready to be published on production for your users, the important question is how would your users access your app. One of the 2 broader ways in which your end users can access your app is organizational access. 

## Invite users to your organization 
You can follow the following steps to give an organizational access of your app to your users:

- Step 1: Navigate to `Share` in your app builder
- Step 2: Enable `Organizational access`
- Step 3: [Invite users](../user-management/adding_users_to_your_account) to your account
- Login to the DronaHQ `end-user portal` (For DronaHQ cloud edition it will be: https://your_subdomain.dronahq.io or your custom domain)

## Access in the End-user portal

All the apps that you publish will be available on the DronaHQ `end-user portal`. You can define different catalogs for your apps for different user groups incase you want to restrict access to specific apps to defined user groups.
