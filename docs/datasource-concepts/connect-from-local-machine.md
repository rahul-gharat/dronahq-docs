## From DronaHQ self-hosted

## From DronaHQ cloud
To connect a database on localhost on DronaHQ's cloud instance user will have to make use of SSH tunneling.

While configuring connector you can pass host as `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` along with rest of the fields in order to connect to local database.
