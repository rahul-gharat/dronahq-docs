# Overview

Veda AI introduces a powerful set of tools that allow users to create, modify, and enhance their applications using natural language prompts. Powered by OpenAI, this feature is embedded directly into the DronaHQ App Builder interface and is designed to accelerate the development process by enabling a more intuitive, conversational way of interacting with the platform.

Instead of manually dragging and configuring controls or writing queries line by line, users can now describe what they want to build or change, and the AI chatbot interprets those instructions to generate UI layouts, component logic, and interactions. The AI can also assist in generating a Business Requirements Document (BRD), creating initial app scaffolds based on those requirements, and allowing users to edit or approve the proposed structure.


## Key Capabilities

Veda AI isn’t here to take over — it’s here to accelerate. Whether you’re mocking up quick screens or tweaking specific components, the AI chatbot can lend a hand in several meaningful ways. You won’t need to know every function to get value out of it — but here are a few of the things it’s already pretty good at:

<!-- - Generate Screens by Just Describing Them -->
- Upload and Build from mock screen.
- Get a BRD Auto-Generated
- Make On-the-Fly Changes with @Mentions
- Add Interactions with Simple Prompts
- Replace Components Mid-Build
- Context-Aware Editing

That’s just the tip of the iceberg — you’ll find more nuanced features, and examples as you move through the rest of the [documentation](getting-started.md).
