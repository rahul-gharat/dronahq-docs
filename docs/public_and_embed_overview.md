# Overview

DronaHQ provides an add-on where you can share DronaHQ apps directly with users and embed them into web apps using iframes or web components. If your apps don't require user authentication, you can create Public apps and embed them into your parent application using a public link.

You can share DronaHQ apps publicly with a Public access link. You can share this link directly with users or embed the app in an iframe in other applications or web pages. These apps can be accessed by anyone on the internet and always reflect the production environment of the app.

To create a Public access link, open an app in the App editor and click the Share button in the top right and enable the public access toggle.
