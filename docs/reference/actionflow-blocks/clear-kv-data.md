## Introduction to Clear From LocalStorage

:::info
It is recommended that the keys which are set globally i.e., accessible via multiple microapps should only be cleared by the apps which set them.
:::

The Clear From LocalStorage action deletes a key-value pair stored in localstorage. This is useful when you need to clear specific data, such as when a user logs out or changes a setting. By removing unnecessary data, this function helps manage storage space and maintain data relevance. In case of web, this action utilizes localstorage to access and clear the data.
