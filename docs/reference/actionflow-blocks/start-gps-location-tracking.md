### Parameters for Secure API Call

Here are the key components of the Start GPS Location Tracking action:

| Configuration Field         | Platform | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Endpoint Url               | Android, iOS     | Server url where to send HTTP POST with recorded locations.                                                                                      |
| Headers                    | Android, iOS     | Optional HTTP headers sent along in HTTP request. Provide Key value pairs ex: {"Content-Type": "application/json"}                              |
| Body                       | Android, iOS     | All wanted location properties have to be prefixed with @. For all available properties check [Location event](https://haylltd.github.io/cordova-background-geolocation-plugin/events#location-event). For Example: {"latitude" : "@latitude", "longitude" : "@longitude", "foo": "bar" } where, @latitude and @longitutude will be replace by actual user’s location lat and long respectively while sending api call.                    |
| Desired Accuracy           | Android, iOS     | Determines how precise the location updates should be. <br />Desired Accuracy defaults to High Accuracy.<br /> `High` - GPS + WiFi/Cell `5-20m accuracy`. ex: Ride-sharing, delivery apps. <br />`Medium` - Uses WiFi/Cell towers primarily `20-100m`.<br /> `Low` - Cell towers only `100m-1km`. ex: Weather apps, city-level tracking.<br /> `Passive` - Only receives updates when others request location. Battery-saving mode, background logging.|
| Location Provider          | Android  | Used to obtain location data. Different providers offer different balances of accuracy, battery efficiency, and availability.<br /> Location Provider defaults to Android Distance Filter Provider.<br />  `Android Distance Filter Provider` - `5-50m` Medium-High Accuracy. ex: Delivery apps, ride-sharing, most tracking needs. <br /> `Android Activity Provider` - `10-100m` Variable. ex: Fitness apps, jogging.<br /> `Raw Provider` - `1-5m` Very High. ex: Surveying, specialized apps needing raw GPS. <br />`Fused Provider` - `5-20m` High. ex: Most modern location-aware apps.                  |
| Stationary Radius          | Android, iOS     | Minimum distance in meters the device must move beyond stationary location for aggressive tracking to engage.<br /> Stationary Radius defaults to 50 meters.<br /> `10–30m` - High Precision tracking (e.g., geofencing, delivery apps).<br />`30–75m` - Urban/suburban tracking.<br />`100–200m` - Fleet tracking or infrequent movement checks.                                  |
| Distance Filter            | Android, iOS     | Minimum distance in meters a device must move before an update event is generated.<br /> Distance Filter defaults to 50 meters. <br />`1–10m` - High-precision tracking (e.g., jogging, surveying). `10–30m` - Urban navigation, ride-sharing, delivery apps .<br />`30–100m` - Fleet tracking, general location updates.<br /> `100m+` - Long-distance travel, battery-saving mode.                                                               |
