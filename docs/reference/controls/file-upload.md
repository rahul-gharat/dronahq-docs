### Allowed File Types

The "Allowed File Types" property of the File Upload control enables you to define the types of files that users can upload using the Filepicker widget. This property accepts an array of wildcards, MIME types, or specific file extensions, providing you with fine-grained control over the accepted file formats.

You have the following options:

- Any: This option allows users to upload files of all the mentioned file types.
- Images: Users can upload image files (e.g., .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif).
- Videos: Users can upload video files.
- Audio: Users can upload audio files.
- MS Office: Users can upload Microsoft Office files (e.g., .docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
- PDF: Users can upload PDF documents.

When JavaScript (JS) is enabled, you can provide the data as an array of strings to specify the accepted file types. For instance, if you want to allow users to upload audio, text, and video files, you can use the following example:

```javascript
[
  "audio/*",
  "text/*",
  "video/*"
]

```
## Control Output

The File Upload control offers important outputs that enable you to work with the uploaded files programmatically. These outputs can be accessed using the control's unique name, such as `fileupload`.

### Files Array

The `files` property stores an array of file objects that the user has selected. Each file object contains information about the selected file, which can be accessed through its properties.

Example:
| Output                          | Description                                                               |  
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `{{fileupload}}`                | An array of selected file objects containing various file properties.   |  
| `{{fileupload.PROPERTIES.FILENAMES}}` | An array of selected file names.                                        |  

To access the filenames of the selected files:  
```javascript
{{fileupload.PROPERTIES.FILENAMES}}
```
