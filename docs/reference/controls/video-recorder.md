# Video Record


The Video Record control allows users to capture videos directly within an application. It offers an intuitive interface with essential actions such as starting, stopping, replaying, and re-recording video clips.

To ensure consistent compatibility across platforms, the recorded video is saved in the `MP4` format, making it widely accessible for playback and upload operations.
