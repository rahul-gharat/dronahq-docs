# Tracking with query string and other UTM params

You can set up your campaigns for tracking using query params by navigating to Setup tracking in the public apps modal. Imagine you are building a registration form which has a few utm params dependent on different sources where you are running this campaign. Generating unique links for each campaign could be the requirement in that case. You can define as many query params to generate a tracking link for these use cases.
