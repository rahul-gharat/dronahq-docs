# Public apps with verified user access

There might be times where you don't want your users to login to a single end-user portal that DronaHQ provides and you want to generate different links for each app yet secure by letting only authenticated users to access it. Enabling this property will ensure that your users will first be redirected to an authentication screen (DronaHQ or SSO whichever is set up in the account) and only once the user is authenticated would they be allowed to access the app.
