# Import JS libraries

DronaHQ Studio offers a robust capability to integrate JavaScript libraries, enabling users to effectively leverage third-party libraries during the application development process. This unique feature enhances flexibility and broadens the range of functionalities that can be incorporated into applications.

Examples of such JavaScript libraries include, but are not limited to, Crypto.js and Underscore.js. Crypto.js provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for various cryptographic operations, while Underscore.js is a utility library that provides useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. Leveraging these, and similar libraries, allows users to create more complex, secure, and efficient applications, with less code and in less time.
