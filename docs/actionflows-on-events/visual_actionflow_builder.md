# Visual actionflow builder

DronaHQ provides a very unique visual experience of building actionflows on any of your app events. There are times you might want to do a sequence of actions on a button click or a value change which can get complex with data queries, API calls, logic and data transformation, branching and iterating and then ending with some visual feedback like showing a toast or a popup. 

You can access control and screen events by clicking on the lightning action on either the screen or the controls.

## Types of events

DronaHQ has broadly 2 types of events and the rest are categorized inside these types:

- **Screen events**
    - **Screen_routing** - This event fires when a routing change in the URL (For public apps) is detected. This fires before the screen_open event. Read more about it in [screen routing.](../../screen_routing)
    - **Screen_open** - This event fires every time the screen opens. It can happen multiple times while using the app even when navigation to this screen happens. 
    - **Screen_close** - This event is the opposite of screen_open. It fires every time you navigate away from this screen.

- **Control events**
    - **Control_click** - This events is fired on clicking the control or parts of the control.
    - **Value_select** - This events is generally associated with select type of controls like dropdowns or radios and is fired every time any option is selected. 
    - **Value_change** - This event is generally associated with input type of controls like textboxes and is fired every time a value changes. You can configure the debounce time in the properties.
    - **Focus_out** - This event is generally associated with input type of controls like textboxes and is fired every time you focus out of the control and click outside.
    - **Enter_press** - This event also is generally associated with input type of controls like searchbox and is fired every time you the user presses enter. 
    - **Custom events** - There are some custom events associated with controls like tablegrid (save_changes on table editing etc.) which let you explore the functionality of these control to the fullest.
