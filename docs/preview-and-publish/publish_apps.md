# Publish apps

DronaHQ provides 2 portals namely, `Creator portal` and `End-user portal`. As a creator or admin whenever you publish a new app, depending on the settings you can use the app as an end user either in the [End-user portal](../../accessing-apps/organizational_access/) or as a [public link](../../accessing-apps/public_access/). While publishing the app you have to write your release notes and a version number which you can roll back to anytime in the future as a stable version. There is also an option to release the app in `beta` which will be available to only users tagged as beta users. [You can read more about it here.](../../releasing_in_beta/)
