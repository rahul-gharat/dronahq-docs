### Filter by Status

Enhance your log viewing experience by using the status filters. Each filter option provides valuable insights into the status of your automation runs.

- `All:` View all automation logs, providing a comprehensive overview of all activities.
- `Completed:` Focus on successfully completed automation logs, highlighting your successful executions.
- `With Error:` Identify automation logs where the overall automation completed, but some tasks within encountered errors.
- `Failed:` Pinpoint logs where the entire automation run failed to execute.

### Filter by Date Range

Fine-tune your log exploration by leveraging the date range filter. This feature allows you to narrow down your search to specific time periods, helping you locate and analyze logs more effectively.

:::info
The power of these filters truly shines when used in conjunction. By combining both filters, you can precisely target and analyze automation logs based on their status and the date of execution.

## Custom Task Logging

In addition to the default task logs, you have the ability to add your own custom messages to be displayed in the Run Logs. This feature proves to be extremely useful for effectively debugging tasks. You can access this feature for each individual task configuration within the `Advanced` accordion.

In [selfhosted](/self-hosted-deployment), you can configure the character limit with [`AUTOMATION_LOGGING_CHARACTER_LIMIT`](/self-hosted-deployment/environment-variables/#automation_logging_character_limit) environment variable.

</figure>

In the Run Log, these custom log messages will be shown alongside the respective tasks they are associated with. To view the custom log message for a specific task, follow these steps:

1. Locate the corresponding task entry in the Run Log.
2. Click on the `Down/Up Arrow` icon located next to the task name.

## Webhook Logs

When dealing with webhooks, you gain access to a set of additional logs that can provide valuable insights into the webhook's operation. These logs include:

- [Payload](#payload).
- [Response](#response).

### Payload

Displays the payload data sent as part of the webhook request.
