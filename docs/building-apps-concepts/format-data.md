For Connectors and when using the output of the Lookup formula, you would get different types of data from the respective sources. Typically, when presenting data in a Table grid control or any card control, you would prefer to make it visually appealing.

You have the option of applying conditional formatting or data type-specific formatting in DronaHQ using the Format Data feature or property available for the table grid control, the detail view control, and the different card controls like compact card, single-user card, long card, and so on. The formatting options would differ based on the type of data. At times you may also apply formatting based on a condition. Now let's see the different types of formatting available.

## Conditional Formatting - Conditions

Typically conditional formatting involves providing the condition to check with the column data and then apply the selected formatting options.

The conditions available are as follows:

| Condition     | Data Type       | Description                              |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| IsEmpty      | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell is empty or does not contain data, then apply a certain format. |
| IsNotEmpty   | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell is not empty or contains data. |
| Equal        | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell value is exactly equal to a certain value. |
| Not Equals   | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell value is not equal to a certain value. |
| Contains     | Text            | If the cell value contains a specified sequence of characters. |
| Not Contains | Text            | If the cell value does not include a specified sequence of characters. |
| Starts with  | Text            | If the cell value begins with the specified sequence of characters. |
| Does not start with | Text     | If the cell value does not begin with the specified sequence of characters. |
| Ends with    | Text            | If the cell value ends with the specified sequence of characters. |
| Does not end with | Text         | If the cell value does not end with the specified sequence of characters. |
| Greater than | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell value is more than a specified value. |
| Less than    | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell value is smaller than a specified value. |
| Greater than equal to | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell value is more than or equal to a specified value. |
| Less than equal to | Text, Date, Time, Datetime, Numeric, Decimal | If the cell value is smaller than or equal to a specified value. |

You can use these conditions in the specific column. If the condition is true, the formatting is applied to that cell/column data, which could include options like bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, cell background color, text color, and icon color.

## Text

Text data types include conditional formatting based on filters/conditions applied to the respective data. The data of the column being formatted should be text or string type data.

## Number and Decimal

For Numeric and Decimal data, you can add either of the following format types: Format, Prefix/Suffix, Conditional formatting.

### Format
Includes options to use the cell values as normal integers or use the Currency or Accounting format.

</figure>


### Prefix/Suffix
You can add a Prefix or a Suffix to your numeric values, such as a currency symbol or a percentage symbol.

### Conditional formatting
If you need to check each value based on a condition, like if the value is more than or equal to a certain amount, you can make use of conditional formatting.




## Single Tag and Multi-Tag

The Single Tag and Multi-Tag components are versatile UI elements that allow users to select one or multiple tags from a predefined list. These components support formatting options for defining how tags are populated, categorized, and displayed, making them adaptable to various use cases like filtering, categorization, or tagging.

</figure>


### Format Options for Adding Tags

Both Single Tag and Multi-Tag components offer two primary ways to configure their options:

1. Manual  
   In this mode, you define the tags explicitly. This is useful when the tags are static and predefined.  
   Example:
   - `High Priority` (Red)
   - `Medium Priority` (Yellow)
   - `Low Priority` (Green)



2. Dynamic  
   In this mode, the tags are populated dynamically using a query or data source. This is useful when the list of tags is large, constantly updated, or derived from a database.  
   Select the Data query in which you can dynamically send the tag values and other meta data. If you map a Data query with "Array of strings" as a format it will auto assign the colors of the tags. In case your Data query is of type JSON - "Array of objects", you can map the values and other meta data below.


## Date, Time, and Datetime  

The `Date`, `Time`, and `Datetime` column types in the table grid offer robust formatting options to handle date and time data efficiently and consistently.  

### Format Options  
- Date Format: Customize how the date is displayed in the column, allowing formats like `dd-mm-yyyy` or `mm/dd/yyyy`.  
- Time Format: Adjust how the time appears, such as `HH:MM` (24-hour) or `hh:mm AM/PM`.  
- UTC / Local: Switch between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Local Time for displaying time-based values accurately.  
- Condition Formatting: Apply custom styles or conditions to the column's data for improved visual representation and analysis.  

### Toggles  
- Without Date: Available for Time column types, this toggle ensures only the time is displayed, removing any associated date values.  
- Allow Empty: Present across Date, Time, and Datetime column types, this toggle allows the field to remain empty, providing flexibility for optional inputs.

## Percent

To format Percent type data, you can specify the limit between which the percentage amount would be formatted.

### Limit
Specify the minimum and maximum limit values. You can enable a progress bar to display in the column if the value is within the specified range.

## Rating

For Rating, you can add different styles to express the kind of rating you are indicating.

### Style
You can set icons like a star, heart shape, and set the color for each of the types, and also provide the maximum number of icons to provide the rating degree.

## Toggle

When you have toggle switches to indicate data, like/dislike, star rating, toggle switch on or off, and so on, you can select styles such as a toggle switch, star, heart, like/dislike, checkmark, or flag.

### Styles
You can provide different styles of toggle symbols and use different colors for them.
