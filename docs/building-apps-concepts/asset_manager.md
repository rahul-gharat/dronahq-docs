# Asset manager

Whatever file uploads you would need in the app builder are driven through the asset manager in DronaHQ. Consider the following scenarios where you might need to upload a static file while building your app:
- Showing a static banner image in image controls
- Uploading a font file to customize the fonts in DronaHQ apps
- Adding a CSV file format in your file parser control

DronaHQ provides an easy way to upload and manage your files you upload for any of these reasons and more. 

:::caution File storage

If you are using DronaHQ cloud edition, all the files you upload or select from any of the ready services is imported and stored in the DronaHQ managed storage. In case of DronaHQ self-hosted edition, it will be stored and maintained on the storage of your choice which you have configured during the installation process.
