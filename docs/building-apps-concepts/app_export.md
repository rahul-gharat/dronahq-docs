# App export

The `App Export` feature allows you to export the entire app in JSON format, which can be useful when migrating app from one account to another, or in case you wish to duplicate the app in the same account.

:::info

The prerequisite for exporting for an app, is that it should be published. Whenever you make any changes to the app, you need to publish it as any unpublished changes will not be exported with the app.

:::

To export an app, navigate to `Config -> App Export` and click on `Export app json`.

If the application is not published, you may see a prompt like this, which will ask you to publish your app before exporting.

In case your application is published, a sidebar will open which will list all the Connectors, Sheets, PDFs, Custom Controls and Widgets used within the application. Click on `Export app json` to save the app's json file on to your machine.
