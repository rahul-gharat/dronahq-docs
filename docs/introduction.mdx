# What is DronaHQ

Organizations build internal applications (also known as admin tools or internal tools) such as dashboards, database GUIs, admin panels, approval apps, customer support tools, and more to help their teams perform specific tasks. DronaHQ is an open source developer tool that helps the rapid creation of such internal tools.

You can drag and drop pre-built widgets to build UI on a grid-style canvas. DronaHQ simplifies front-end and back-end integration between the UI and the datasource to optimize building applications. It also supports JavaScript inside widgets, queries, and almost any other component to add logic, transform data, and define complex workflows.

## Why DronaHQ

DronaHQ makes it easy to build a UI that talks to any datasource. You can create anything from simple CRUD apps to complicated multi-step workflows with the simple steps below:

- **Connect Datasource**: Integrate with a datasource such as a database or an API. DronaHQ has plug-and-play support for many databases and the RESTful API interface to connect with most tools seamlessly.
- **Build UI**: Use customizable built-in widgets to build an app layout.
- **Access Data**: Connect UI to the datasource by writing queries and binding the data to widgets. Control everything with JavaScript.
- **Collaborate, Deploy, Share**: DronaHQ supports version control using Git to build apps in collaboration using branches to track and roll back changes. Deploy the app and share it with other users.
