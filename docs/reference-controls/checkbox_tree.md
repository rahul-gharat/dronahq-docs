## Bind Data Option

CheckBox Tree control accepts JSON array of objects, representing hierarchical information in a tree-like structure. There are different ways in which you can bind data to the CheckBox Tree control.

### Static Data Option

To display static options in the CheckBox Tree control, you can use the Bind Data option. The Bind Data option must be specified a JSON array of objects. For example:

```js
[
  {
    "text": "Animals",
    "id": "animals",
    "children": [
      {
        "text": "Mammals",
        "id": "mammals",
        "children": [
          {
            "text": "Dog",
            "id": "dog"
          },
          {
            "text": "Cat",
            "id": "cat"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "text": "Birds",
        "id": "birds",
        "children": [
          {
            "text": "Parrot",
            "id": "parrot"
          },
          {
            "text": "Eagle",
            "id": "eagle"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

```
This JSON array represents a tree with two main parent nodes: "Animals" and its children "Mammals" and "Birds." Each of these child nodes has their own children, such as "Dog" and "Cat" under "Mammals" and "Parrot" and "Eagle" under "Birds." The "id" property provides a unique identifier for each node in the tree structure.
