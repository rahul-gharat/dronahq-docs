A Date Picker control is used to accept dates into a microapp by selecting a date from a calendar widget. You can set User Deviceâ€™s date as a default date or can keep the Date picker empty when the date control is displayed to the user. Date picker saves the Date in the Unix epoch time format. For example, it can be used for various purposes like setting due dates for tasks or Start and End dates for an event.

## Binding Data Options

There are different ways to bind data to the Date Picker control, providing either a single date or a range of dates.

### Static Data Options

The expected formats for binding data to the Date Picker control are either the `UNIX timestamp format` or the `DATE Object`.

```
UNIX timestamps in milliseconds.

Selected Date: 1625198400000
```

```
DATE Object format.

Selected Date: new Date(2023, 6, 1)
```

To illustrate an example, let's consider a scenario where you are creating a hotel reservation system, and you want to set the default date selection to be 10 days from the current date.

To achieve this, you can go to the Bind Data Option, `Selected Date -> Quick Select -> Custom JS`, and write a JavaScript function to retrieve a date that is 10 days ahead of the current date. Below is an example code that utilizes the Moment.js library:

```js
function JSCode(output) {
  var selectedDate = moment().add(10, 'days').toDate();
  output = selectedDate;
  return output;
}
```

When binding data to the Date Picker control, consider the format of the data: `LOCAL` or `UNIX timestamp`.
Choose the appropriate `Submit format` in the `Input Properties` of the control: `LOCAL` for `LOCAL` format and
`UTC` for `UNIX timestamp`. This ensures accurate handling of dates and times based on the data format.
