This advance map is useful to mark multiple coordinates using various available tools. This control also can handle an array of objects as data in the bind data section.

## Binding Data Options

There are different ways to bind data to the Advance Map control. There are different ways in which you can bind data to the control.

:::info

To bind data in the Advance Map control, the array of objects should include at least two keys: "type" and "coordinates". The "type" key should correspond to one of the available tools in the control, such as polyline, polygon, rectangle, circle, marker, or circlemarker. This ensures that the data is properly recognized and rendered in the control.

:::

### Static Data Option

To display static options in the Advance Map control, you can use the Bind Data option. The Bind Data option must be specified as an array of objects. For example:

```js

[
    {
        "type_columns": "polygon",
        "coords_colms": [
            [37.027806488554226, -109.07024512949624],
            [26.3609046933067, -108.45509635025923],
            [26.518303305297817, -97.90968870619635],
            [36.746614738361394, -100.19452702907665]
        ]
    }
