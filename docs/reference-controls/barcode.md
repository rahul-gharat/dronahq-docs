The Barcode Control is an advanced control that enables barcode scanning for mobile apps. Using the device's camera, the control scans barcodes and fetches the related code text.

## Binding Data Options

 There are different ways in which you can bind data to the Barcode control.

### Example: Static Data 

Let's explore a practical example to demonstrate that the Barcode Control can be utilized to submit product data, including its barcode, and visualize the scanning action. Additionally, integrate a text control to display the scanned barcode value. 

- You can add an automation to your app that will handle the data submission process. For example, when the barcode is scanned and the value is obtained, the automation will be triggered to submit this data to a designated sheet.

- When they reach the Barcode scan field and tap on "Scan," the mobile phone's camera will act as a barcode scanner.

- The scanned barcode value will be displayed in the text box that is linked to the Barcode Control, making it visible to users.

For instance, if you are running a retail store, this functionality can help you efficiently manage your inventory. As products are scanned, their barcode values are saved to a sheet, providing you with a centralized and organized product database.
