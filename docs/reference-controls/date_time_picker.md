Date & Time Picker control is used to accept date and time into a microapp by selecting them from a calendar and clock widget respectively. You can set the user deviceâ€™s date and time as a default or can keep the picker empty when the date and time control is displayed to the user. Date & Time picker saves the Date & Time in Unix epoch time format. It can be used for various purposes like accepting appointments.

## Binding Data Options

There are different ways to bind data to the Date Time Picker control. You can provide both the date and time using static data options in either UNIX timestamp format or the JavaScript `Date` object format.

### Static Data Options

Example using UNIX timestamp format:

```
UNIX timestamps in milliseconds.

Date and Time: 1627868341000
```

Example using JavaScript `Date` object format:

```
JavaScript Date object.

Date and Time: new Date("2023-08-02T09:39:01")
```

Consider a scenario where you are building an event scheduling application, and you need to set specific dates and times for events. You can use either the UNIX timestamp format or the JavaScript `Date` object format for the binding.

To provide the date and time dynamically, go to Bind Data Option, `Date Time -> Quick Select -> Custom JS`, and write a JavaScript function to retrieve the desired date and time. Below is an example code that utilizes the Moment.js library for UNIX timestamp format:

```js
function JSCode(output) {
  var dateTime = moment().add(2, 'days').set({ hour: 9, minute: 39, second: 1 }).format('x');
  output = dateTime;
  return output;
}
```

To provide the date and time using JavaScript `Date` object format:

```js
function JSCode(output) {
  var dateTime = new Date("2023-08-02T09:39:01");
  output = dateTime;
  return output;
}
```


:::info

When binding data to the Date Time Picker control, consider the format of the data: UNIX timestamp or JavaScript `Date` object. Choose the appropriate `Submit format` in the `Input Properties` of the control: `UTC` for UNIX timestamp format and `LOCAL` for JavaScript `Date` object format. This ensures accurate handling of dates and times based on the data format.
