The Cascader Control serves the purpose of defining the exact location or path of an element. By utilizing parent-child relationships, it enables users to navigate through the multi-level tree and determine the endpoint of the path.

This control combines the functionality of a select and input field, allowing users to select values from the tree structure. It also supports direct input for searching values and includes validation for ensuring required fields are filled.
