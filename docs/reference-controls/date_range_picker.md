The Date Range Picker control in DronaHQ is a composite control that provides two outputs: the start date and end date.
It allows users to select a range of dates from a calendar widget in the app. This control offers several properties
that enable you to include time selection as well.

The Date Range Picker control saves the selected date and time in timestamp format, measured in milliseconds. It can be
used for various purposes, such as accepting appointments or scheduling events that require a specific time range.

## Binding Data Options

There are different ways to bind data to the Date Range Picker control. From the Bind Data, you can provide both the
start date and the end date.

### Static Data Options

The expected and best practice format for binding data to the Date Range Picker control is `UNIX timestamp format` or
the `"MM/DD/YYYY" date format`.

```
UNIX timestamps in milliseconds.

Start Date: 1625198400000
End Date: 1627876799000

```

```
"MM/DD/YYYY" date format.

Start Date: "07/01/2023"
End Date: "07/31/2023"

```

Consider a scenario where you are developing a leave application system for your employees. As a requirement, employees
are required to apply for leave at least 15 days in advance.

To meet the requirement, the Date Range picker in the leave application system should dynamically disable the next 15
days.

Go to Bind Data Option, `StartDate -> Quick Select -> Custom JS` and write a JavaScript function to retrieve a date that
is 15 days ahead of the current date. Below is an example code that utilizes the Moment.js library:

```js
function JSCode(output) {
  var startDate = moment().add(15, 'days').format('LLL');
  output = startDate;
  return output;
}
```

When binding data to the Date Range Picker control, consider the format of the data: `DD/MM/YYYY` or `UNIX timestamp`.
Choose the appropriate `Submit format` in the `Input Properties` of the control: `LOCAL` for `DD/MM/YYYY` format and
`UTC` for `UNIX timestamp`. This ensures accurate handling of dates and times based on the data format.
