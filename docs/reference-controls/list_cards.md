Various card types are designed to present tabulated data in layouts according to their specific purposes. For instance, the News Card is optimized for news feeds, displaying headlines in a reader-friendly format. On the other hand, the Single User Card provides lists such as contacts, employees, and task lists, offering a detailed view tailored to individual users. While each card may have unique attributes, they generally share common features, ensuring a consistent user experience.
