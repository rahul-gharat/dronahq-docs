## Binding Data Options

The Sortable control allows you to display data in the form of an array of objects. Each object must contain properties such as fullname, email, department, and avatar.

### Static Data Option

To display static data in the Sortable control, you need to provide an array of objects in JSON format. Each object should have the following properties:

- fullname: Represents the full name of the individual.
- email: Represents the email address of the individual.
- department: Represents the department to which the individual belongs.
- avatar: Represents the URL of the avatar image associated with the individual.

Example:

```js
[
  {
    "fullname": "Maria Gerhold",
    "email": "maria81@example.com",
    "department": "IT",
    "avatar": "https://avatar.com/hyy45302.jpeg"
  },
  {
    "fullname": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "department": "HR",
    "avatar": "https://avatar.com/abc12345.jpeg"
  },
  {
    "fullname": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
    "department": "Marketing",
    "avatar": "https://avatar.com/xyz67890.jpeg"
  }
]
```

:::info
 Please ensure that the properties for the avatar image and title might vary based on your data source. In such cases, you can bind them again using the respective column dropdowns in the properties menu.
