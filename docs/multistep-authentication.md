# Multistep Authentication

`Multistep Authentication` method is a nested or custom authentication. With multistep authentication, the user can provide two or more forms of authentication. A multistep authentication scheme considers using different resources of the same authentication factor to allow a user to access systems or information.

## What you'll need

- DronaHQ Mobile App must be above `8.3.0` and above version for using multi-step `OAuth-type > Non-shared credentials connector`.

## Configuring the third-party API connector

To add third-party connectors, under `DronaHQ > Connectors`, click `(+) Connector`.

:::info

`DronaHQ` has different options including the use of the REST API and GraphQL that allows you to easily connect to the Third-Party API and database and access important systems. Both of them have a multistep authentication feature. We will be selecting the REST API for this example.

:::

### Configure API Category

When configuring the APIs you need to provide the Authentication details for the respective authentication method. Let us see how to configure an API using the multistep authentication method.
Once you select the REST API, enter the Connector name which should ideally be self-explanatory.

In the Authentication section, select `Multistep Authentication`.

  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/select-api-authentication.png" alt="Select API Authentication" width='70%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Select Multistep Authentication</i></figcaption>
</figure>

## Configure Cookies settings <span style={{"font-size": "20px", "font-weight": "600", "opacity": ".7"}}>(optional)</span>

  In Multistep Authentication, there are two cookie settings available: `Forward All Cookies` throughout the process, and `Follow double submit cookie pattern`.

### Forward All Cookies

  Cookie forwarding is an essential feature in DronaHQ's backend functioning for cookie-based authentication. When a client makes an initial API request, the API responds with a cookie containing an authentication token or session ID, which is retrieved from the response header and stored. DronaHQ then automatically includes and forwards this cookie as a header in all subsequent requests made to that API or connector, ensuring a seamless authentication process.

  <figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/forward-all-cookies.png" alt="Forward all cookies" width='70%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Select Forward all cookies</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Follow double submit cookie pattern

  The "Double Submit Cookie Pattern" is a highly secure option available when configuring Multistep Authentication in DronaHQ. Alongside the "Forward All Cookies" checkbox, you have the option to select this pattern. The concept is straightforward: a random value is generated and sent both as a cookie and as a parameter during API requests. The server ensures that both values match, providing an extra layer of security.

  Here's how the process works in DronaHQ: When a session is created from an API request, the received cookie, derived from the session ID, is set in the user's browser. Simultaneously, another cookie containing the CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token is set. When the user submits a secure form, the token is extracted from the cookie and placed as a hidden input field in the HTML. During server-side processing, the received token in the form parameter is validated against the cookie value, granting authorization for the intended action to be completed. This ensures that the request is legitimate and not susceptible to CSRF attacks.

 <figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/double-submit-cookie.png" alt="Follow double submit cookie pattern" width='70%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Select Follow double submit cookie pattern</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Provide the name of the incoming cookie as well as the name and location you want to pass your cookie. This name is usually application dependent.

## Configure account-specific fields

Configuring account-specific fields for multistep authentication requires adding:

- Configure Multistep variables.
- Configure Auth Flow.
- Configure Refresh Auth Flow.
- Update variables.
- Configure Request Parameter.
- Sign-in Type.
- Configure Test API.
- Add Name for Test API.

### Configure Multistep Variables

select `Use multistep variables` and click on `+ Add variable` to create variable with static value and you can use that variable in `Auth Flow` and `Refresh Auth Flow`

:::info Leveraging Output Variables in Sequential Steps
  In this process, each step generates an output variable that can be utilized in the subsequent steps. For example, you can  access the value of `{{form1.username}}` to refer to the username captured in the first form.
:::

After configuring the authentication steps, you can proceed by clicking on `Test Auth flow` to observe the output of the authentication process in action.

You can copy the step and click on Paste step; this will paste the configuration details copied in your clipboard and implement this as a step in multistep authentication steps as well as for refresh flow but the refresh flow will not accept anything other than API request, JS Code, OAuth v1.0a and SSO Token details.

:::

### Configure Refresh Auth Flow

  You can configure a set of multiple steps that run automatically after a `401 response` when requesting API. This is useful for refreshing a user’s authentication session without them needing to refresh the page.
  
export const refreshSteps = [
  {
    title: 'API Request',
    description:
      'where you can configure it to make an API request to your server to obtain an authentication token. Simply provide the URL, from where you want to get back the request call output.',

  },
  {
    title: 'SSO Token',
    description: 'This method will provide output variables based on the active SSO token in the current account',
    link: '#sso-token',
  },
];

  - You can either add your own steps by clicking `+ Add Step` and then you will get options to select from such as.

  <GenerateCardGallery cards={refreshSteps} />

    you can also paste the copied steps from your clipboard by clicking `Paste step`.

    Once you have configured the Refresh flow steps, similar to the Auth Flow, you can proceed by clicking on `Test Refresh flow` to witness the Refresh flow process in action and observe its output.

  - Or you can toggle on the `Same as Auth Flow` button, it will use the same auth steps mentioned in Multistep Authentication.

    You also get a toggle button of `Use Stored Credentials`; This is useful to fetch the stored credentials and use it in the `form modal` automatically without showing it to the end user at the time of refreshing.
    <figure>
      <Thumbnail align = "center" src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/same-as-auth-flow.png" alt="Same as Auth Flow" width='70%'/>
      <figcaption align = "center"><i>Same as Auth Flow</i></figcaption>
    </figure>


### Update Variables

:::info 
  This section becomes accessible only if the `Same as Auth Flow` option is not selected.
:::
you need to update the variables from your refresh auth flow output to your actual auth flow output in order to use it in the next step of multistep authentication. Updating variables comes in use when we face an error and the Refresh Auth flow takes action. This creates a new auth token saved in different parameters, so in order to send the new token as a header to test our API endpoint, we need to set the variable’s value of Auth flow the same as of Refresh Auth flow.

To add an Update variable, simply click on `+ Add variable`. On the left side, specify the `Auth Flow output` variable, and on the right side, provide the corresponding `Refresh flow output` variable within double curly brackets `{{}}`. You have the flexibility to update both `single-level` and `nested-level` variables.

    <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/update-variable.png" alt="Update Variables" width='75%'/>
    <figcaption align = "center"><i>Update Variables</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

### Configure Request Parameter

This section is to save the authentication token which we get back from the server, as parameters.
These parameters will be added into all the API endpoints for all your added Api’s automatically in respective locations (Querystring/header/body).

To add an Request parameter, simply click on `+ Add parameter`.

    <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/request-parameter.png" alt="Request Parameter" width='75%'/>
    <figcaption align = "center"><i>Request Parameter</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

### Configure Sign-In Type <span style={{"font-size": "20px", "font-weight": "600", "opacity": ".7"}}>(optional)</span>

This allows to set the authentication type for the resource API. `Sign-In Type` supports 
  - NTLM Authentication.
  - OAuth V1.0a.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/sign-in-type-ntlm.png" alt="Sign-in Type NTLM Authentication" width='75%'/>

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Sign-in Type OAuth V1.0a</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Configure Test API

Add a simple API endpoint to test user credentials. DronaHQ includes data from your input form in the URL Params by default; click Advanced to customize the API call if your API expects them in the header instead.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/configure-test-api.png" alt="Configure Test API for connector" width='75%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Configure Test API for connector</i></figcaption>
</figure>

After ensuring that all the essential configurations are in place, you can simply save your work once it has been successfully tested.

:::info Exploring the Cache Method in Multistep Authentication
  DronaHQ maintains two different types of cache data, one in the frontend/browser and one in the backend/ DronaHQ cloud.
All the outputs from our auth flow steps – `form`, `API request`, `OAuth V2`, and `others`- are cached in the frontend securely whereas all the outputs from our auth flow with shared credentials – `OAuth V2`, `OAuth V2 - Client Credentials`, `OAuth V2 - PKCE`- are cached in the backend in this way tokens/outputs are never directly exposed to end user.

You can also clear cached data present in the front end from the `Query` of the configured connector by clicking on `Clear cached auth`. It is helpful to either rerun the auth flow or use different credentials other than stored previously

  <figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/clear-cached-auth.png" alt="Clear cached auth" width='50%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Clear cached auth</i></figcaption>
</figure>
:::

## Managed Auth Screen

We have a toggle button of `Show Managed Auth screen during app start` under `Settings > App Settings > Multistep Auth Connector`.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/Managed-auth-screen-setting.png" alt="Managed auth screen setting" width='75%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Managed auth screen setting</i></figcaption>
</figure>

By enabling this setting, you gain access to a unified screen that displays all multistep authentication types used in our app. This convenient feature allows you to authenticate all configured services within the app on a single page, streamlining the process and consolidating multistep authentication connectors across various controls.

Additionally, it displays all the Multi-Step Connectors utilized in your app to date. Consider deselecting any unused Multi-Step Connectors within the app.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/managed-auth-screen-preview.png" alt="Managed auth screen preview" width='50%'/>
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Managed auth screen preview</i></figcaption>
</figure>

:::caution Frequent Authentication Prompts and Potential API Crash

When the toggle is set to `OFF`, each action on the app screen will prompt for authentication. In situations where a single multistep authentication connector is used across different controls on the same screen, you'll need to authenticate repeatedly for each popup. Neglecting to do so can lead to potential crashes when fetching data from the API endpoint during the authentication process.
:::

However, `DronaHQ` smartly utilizes previously entered credentials for different screens, provided the connector remains the same. This optimization ensures an enhanced user experience by reducing redundant authentication steps and avoiding unnecessary prompts during multistep authentication.

## Navigate to Authentication screen – Action Flow

When a user needs to clear the cached authentication data or switch to different credentials for connector authentication, DronaHQ offers an on-screen action called `Navigate to Authentication Screen`. This action facilitates the clearing of cached tokens saved in the backend/frontend of the app after successfully authenticating the connector.
  <figure>
    <Thumbnail src="/img/advanced-concepts/multistep-auth/navigate-to-auth-screen-action.png" alt="Navigate To Authentication screen (Action)" width='70%'/>
    <figcaption align = "center"><i>Navigate To Authentication screen (Action)</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

In the following screen of `Configure Action's Fields`, you will encounter a dropdown menu where you can choose between two options: `Reload App after Authentication` or `Continue without Reloading`.

When set to `TRUE`, after the user authenticates on the Managed Auth screen and clicks Continue, the app will be `reloaded`, starting from the beginning. However, if set to `FALSE`, after the user authenticates on the Managed Auth screen and clicks Continue, the app will `resume` from where the user left off, and all data will remain unchanged.

### Callback Auth

A custom auth type which allows to extract data from query parameters after authorizing the user, which is usually a sign-in to the app's portal. Much similar to the authorization flow of user in OAuth v2.
  - `Decode params` - when it toggle `ON` it will decode the query params from the redirect url

:::info Dynamic Output variables
  In this Callback Auth, the name of the output variable will change depending on the output received. Therefore, after configuring the callback auth step, it is essential to test the authentication flow by clicking `Test Auth flow` button to obtain the updated output variables before proceeding with the configuration of the remaining flow.
:::

### Form

  After selecting the form, you will be prompted to provide various details, including the form `modal title` and the addition of input keys. These input keys can be of different types, such as `text`, `email`, `number`, and `password`. The purpose of these input keys is to enable the end-user to provide the necessary information to successfully authenticate with the backend. DronaHQ will automatically generate output variables based on the input fields

  You have the flexibility to include multiple input keys in the form, each serving a specific purpose:

  1. `Text`: Use this for text-only input in the form.
  2. `Number`: Utilize this for entering numeric values in the form.
  3. `Email`: Specify this input type to capture email addresses with the correct email ID format.
  4. `Password`: Save this input type for securely storing password-related information.

  By incorporating these input keys into the form, you can create a robust and user-friendly authentication process that caters to different data requirements.
