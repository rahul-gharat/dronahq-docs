# **DronaHQ-Managed LLM Policies**

*Applicable to customers on any plan.*

AI-Enabled Applications and Customer Agents may rely on Supported LLMs. When a Customer chooses to use a [**DronaHQ-Managed LLM**](https://docs.dronahq.com/reference/connectors/dronahq-managed-ai/), the Customer is required to comply with the usage policies and requirements issued by the provider of that LLM (“**DronaHQ-Managed LLM Policies**”). These provider policies may be updated periodically by the respective model provider.
