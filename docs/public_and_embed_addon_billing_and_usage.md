# Add-on billing and usage

DronaHQ public and embed apps are metered on the number of views of these apps. Simply select the plan that aligns with your specific requirements, and you will be billed accordingly on a monthly or annual basis, depending on your preference.

To manage your organization's billing, including plan selection and adjustments, you can access the Billing settings within your DronaHQ account. This centralized location allows you to conveniently view and switch between available plans and add more views, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

At DronaHQ, we understand the importance of providing transparent and tailored billing options to our valued users. By offering scalable plans and intuitive billing management, we aim to support your organization's growth and enable a seamless user experience.

You can see the usage of the views in the Public and embed apps section of each app on DronaHQ. Please note that these views are aggregated across all apps and are not individual to each app. 

:::info Billing info

Any upgrade of views, depending on the billing cycle (monthly/annual) will be charged on a pro-rata basis. Every Add-on will have its own different billing cycle and invoicing.

Incase you have multiple instances of self-hosted DronaHQ edition installed on-premise, the view count will be the aggregation of all users distinct or unique across all instances.
