## DATESTR

This is a custom function that converts date (Unix format) to readable date format, say, 29/Apr/2019. 

### Definition

 DATESTR(date,format,isLocalTime)
`isLocalTime` is an optional parameter.

### Example 1

```js
 DATESTR(TODAY(),"MM/DD/YYYY")
 ```

`Output`

> 12/12/2019

### Example 2

```js
 DATESTR(datepicker,"DD YYYY")
```

### Concept

This is a custom function that converts date (Unix format) to readable date format, say, 29/Apr/2019.

**Syntax** - **DATESTR(date,format,isLocalTime)**

where 
* `date` is a UNIX date
* `format` can be any of the following keywords - 

    `dddd` will return Monday <br/>
    `ddd` will return Mon <br/>
    `dd` will return Mo <br/>
    `d` will return 1 <br/>
    `DD` will return 29 <br/>
    `MM` will return 04 <br/>
    `M` will return 4 <br/>
    `MMM` will return Apr <br/>
    `MMMM` will return April <br/>
    `YY` will return 19 <br/>
    `YYYY` will return 2019 <br/>
    `MM/DD/YYYY` will return 04/29/2019 <br/>
    `HH` will return hour in 24hr format - 17 <br/>
    `hh` will return hour in 12hr format - 5 <br/>
    `hh:mm:ss` will return Hour:Minutes:Seconds in 12hr format <br/>
    `hh:mm:ss a` will return Hour:Minutes:Seconds am/pm in 12hr format. You can also put ` A ` instead of ` a ` to show AM/PM instead of am/pm respectively. <br/>

* `isLocalTime`: is enabled or disabled to specify the output to be formatted to local time. Default output time is UTC.

#### Example -

Let's say, we input date from a Date Picker control (unique name - datepicker) and use the DATESTR() in another control, say Text, then the formula will be -

```js
DATESTR(datepicker,"MM/DD/YYYY")
```js

The output will be `04/29/2019` , when date selected in Date Picker is 29th April 2019.

Let's say, we input time from a DateTime Picker control (unique name - datetimepicker) and use the DATESTR() in another control, say Text, then the formula will be  written to get time for the local time zone as:

```js
DATESTR(datetimepicker,"DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm" , 1)
```

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/date-str-local.jpeg" alt="Date in Local Timezone" />
  <figcaption><i>Date in Local Timezone</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The same without the local time zone would be written as

```js
DATESTR(datetimepicker,"DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm" , 0)
```

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/date-str-utc.jpeg" alt="Date in UTC Timezone" />
  <figcaption><i>Date in UTC Timezone</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Here as the time zone is disabled the output is in the UTC.

## DATEDIF

Calculates the number of days, months, or years between two dates.

### Definition

 DATEDIF(start_date,end_date,unit)

Where, **unit** is "D" which returns the number of days in the period.

### Example 1

Let's assume, you have two date controls (datepicker and datepicker1) on the screen. If you try the below formula in another control for e.g numeric or text control, the output function is defined as follows.

```js
DATEDIF( datepicker , datepicker1 , "D")
```

which would then return the difference in days between the dates.

### Example 2

```js
    DATEDIF(TODAY(), "09/09/2020", "D")
```

Assuming TODAY() is 23- July-2020) the output will be 47 days.

## MAPKEYS

Is used for mapping the keys to the new key names and displaying them likewise. It is further useful to change the order of the fetched columns.

### Definition

```js
MAPKEYS([ArrayOfJsonobjects.Key1,ArrayOfJsonobjects.Key2,…],"newkeyname1,newkeyname2,…")

OR

MAPKEYS([ArrayOfJsonobjects.Key1,ArrayOfJsonobjects.Key2,…],"newkeyname1:Key1,newkeyname2:Key2,…")

OR

MAPKEYS([ArrayOfJsonobjects.Key1,ArrayOfJsonobjects.Key2,…],"Key1 AS newkeyname1, Key2 AS newkeyname2, …")
```

Where,

* `Newkeyname<1>:`  is the new label assigned to the respective key
* `Key<1>:`  is the default key name or label of the respective header of the populated columns from any source

The columns would be displayed in the order specified when defining the keynames.

### Example 1

```js
MAPKEYS( LOOKUP([Prod_depend_Doc.Prod_ID,Prod_depend_Doc.Prod_name,Prod_depend_Doc.Quantity,Prod_depend_Doc.Price]) , "Prod_name AS ProductName , Quantity AS Qty, Price AS CostPrice, Prod_ID AS ProductID")
```

where -
`AS` is used to define the new keyname and the order of columns has been changed as well. 


## FILTER

This is used to fetch data from a data store and provide  filtered data from that data store. The FILTER function is ideally used with the list controls like TableGrid and Detail view.

### Definition

```js
FILTER([datastore.columnname1, datastore.columnname2,…], Filter or Condition, Sort column,Order)
```

Where,
* [datastore](/reference-controls/data-store-control) : is the name of the datastore created earlier to fetch data from a sheet or API.
* `Columnname` : is the column whose data is to be fetched.
  * In case you need to fetch data from more than one column, then add the list of columns within the square [ ] brackets separated by comma as [datastore.columnname1,datastore.columnname2]
* Filter:  is the filter format to fetch data from the column.

### Filter Truth Table

### Example

```js
FILTER ([prod_datastore.result.rows.name, prod_datastore.result.rows.author_id] , prod_datastore.result.rows.author_id > 6,prod_datastore.result.rows.name, “DESC”)
```

For More Info on using the funtion  - Refer the [article here](https://community.dronahq.com/t/using-the-filter-function).


## BINDAPI

The `BINDAPI()` function is used to fetch data from a connector data source and bind it to a control. Also you can optionally filter data and sort fetched data in ascending or descending order.

### Definition

```js
BINDAPI([connectorname.result.rows.columnname1, connectorname.result.rows.columnname2,…], Filter Condition, Sort column,Order)

Where,
* `Connectorname.result.rows.columnname`: is the column whose data is to be fetched.
  * In case you need to fetch data from more than one column, then add the list of columns within the square [ ] brackets separated by comma as [Connectorname.result.rows.columnname1,Connectorname.result.rows.columnname2]
* `[Filter](/reference_fx_formulas/#filter-truth-table)`: is the filter format to fetch data from the column. There are three components as Columns to be filtered, filter[ operator](https://intercom.help/dronahq-studio/formula/supported-operators-and-keywords/how-to-use-operators) & filter criteria. In case you need to state multiple filters you can use AND (for all filter criteria match) or OR (for any one of the filter criteria match).
  * The condition will be taken as datastore.columnname1=""

The parameters mentioned below are optional:

* `Sorting`: is used to sort the result set on the basis of the column specified.
* `Order`: is the order in which you want to sort the data fetched from the sheet. It can have value either ASC or DESC which needs to be put within double quotes “”.

`Important Note:` Filter and Sorting happen at the client-side once we get the result from API.

### Example

```js
BINDAPI( [userlist.members.id,userlist.members.name,userlist.members.profile.email])


BINDAPI( [AuthorMongoDB.result.rows.author_id,AuthorMongoDB.result.rows.name,AuthorMongoDB.result.rows.last_name], AuthorMongoDB.result.rows.name $cn “A”, AuthorMongoDB.result.rows.last_name, “DESC”)
```

For More Info on using the funtion  - Refer the `[article here](https://community.dronahq.com/t/using-the-bindapi-function)`.


## STRINGTOJSON

When you have a string JSON, for example in scenarios where the server returns JSON as strings, you can make use of this function to convert the string to a JSON.

### Definition

```js
STRINGTOJSON(string JSON)
```

Where,

* `String JSON` : is a valid JSON of type String

The function will parse the JSON column data of a single row only.

### Example

```js
STRINGTOJSON(LOOKUP([sheet.jsonColumn],sheet.unique_id=12))
```

This will result into the LOOKUP fetching the String column from the Sheet where the Unique Id is 12 and returning it as a JSON.

## MERGEJSON

The MERGEJSON function allows you to parse the data from multiple rows of a JSON column. The JSON column would contain an array of objects.

### Definition

```js
 MERGEJSON(LOOKUP([sheet.jsonColumn]))
```

Where,
* `sheet`: is the sheet that contains a JSON column
* `jsonColumn`: is the column that contains an array of objects.

### Example

```js
 MERGEJSON( LOOKUP([Prod_depend_Doc.json_array]))
```

returns an array of JSON objects.

For More Info on using the funtion  - Refer the `[article here](https://community.dronahq.com/t/using-mergejson-function)`.

## GETKEYVALUE

When you need to get only the value from a specific key typically where key-value pairs are returned, you can use the `GETKEYVALUE` function.

### Definition

```js
 GETKEYVALUE(object, “keyname”)
```

Where,

* `object`: is the JSON object from where the value is to be fetched.
* `Keyname`: is the default key name or label of the JSON object.

### Example

```js
 GETKEYVALUE( STRINGTOJSON( LOOKUP([Prod_depend_Doc.json_object] , Prod_depend_Doc.unique_id = 1)) , “name”)
```

returns the value in the “name” key i.e. John in this case.

For More Info on using the funtion - Refer the `[article here](https://community.dronahq.com/t/using-getkeyvalue-function)`.

## ARRAYTOCSV

The ARRAYTOCSV function converts your array data into comma-separated values .

### Definition

```js
 `ARRAYTOCSV`(ArrayValue)
```

Where,

* ArrayValue is an array input.

### Example

```js
 ARRAYTOCSV(array[“a”,“b”,“c”] )
```

Will result into: a,b,c

### Concept

This is typically useful for cases like where you want to send Slack Message as a sprint and not as a list of items, then in that case you can make use of the function. At times you may want to add or update the record as a string and not an array for the respective column in databases like those in MySQL, MongoDB and so on. Then in that scenario converting your array to a CSV is always beneficial.

Let us take a simple example here to select cities from a checkbox control and view the data in a text control. We have enabled Show Raw data in this case. Now note the output on selection of multiple cities. It is an array that is returned here.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/array-to-csv-ui.png" alt="Multiselect UI for Array output" />
  <figcaption><i>Multiselect UI for Array output</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Let us add an **Action flow** to show the string as a Popup. Add a compute block to the action flow. To the variable assign the value returned by ARRAYTOCSV. Use keywords and display the value in the Popup. 

Formula: In this example, we are using the **citiesvisited ** which returns the selected options of checkbox control.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/array-to-csv-fx.png" alt="ARRAYTOCSV Fx configured" />
  <figcaption><i>ARRAYTOCSV Fx configured</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now if you take a preview of the form note the output in the popup block where we used the variable in the Message field.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/array-to-csv-output.png" alt="ARRAYTOCSV Fx result" />
  <figcaption><i>ARRAYTOCSV Fx result</i></figcaption>
</figure>

## SHOWDETAILS

This is used to show the details from the selected row of the TableGrid control. It displays the selected data from TableGrid in Detail View control. The value returned by the function is a JSON array with the dynamic keys provided in the function.

### Definition

```js
 SHOWDETAILS(“newkey1”, tablegrid.columnname1,”newkey2”, tablegrid.columnname2)
```

Where,

* `Newkey<1>:` is the new label assigned to the respective key
* `tablegrid.columnname<1>`: is the specific column from the tablegrid control.

Here you can also change the order in which the keys appear. So the records will be displayed in the order in which you added the new keys.

### Example

```js
 SHOWDETAILS(“name”, tableGrid.name, “id”, tableGrid.id)
```

### Concept

Usually, the order of the keys or columns would be the same as the order in which you have fetched them. However, if you want to reorder it when displaying data in the Detail view control, you can change the order in the SHOWDETAILS function and the data would be presented accordingly.

Now let us fetch the data from a Database connector in a table grid control.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/showdetails-tablegrid.jpeg" alt="Tablegrid Control" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Tablegrid Control</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Then add a Detail view control. In the **Custom formula** of the detail view control, add the SHOWDETAILS function using the above syntax.


<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/showdetails-detailview.jpeg" alt="SHOWDETAILS Fx configured" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>SHOWDETAILS Fx configured</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now if we take a preview and select a row from the tablegrid, the same would be displayed in the **Detail view** control.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/showdetails-result.jpeg" alt="SHOWDETAILS Fx result" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>SHOWDETAILS Fx result</i></figcaption>
</figure>

## ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE

The `ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE` function helps you to ignore the double quotes that are typically present in JSON type data returned by the server or by advanced controls like Form Repeat control, Summary control, and so on.

### Definition

```js
 ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE(string/text/json value)
```

Where,

* `<string/text/json value>`: is the JSON value returned by APIs or control selections

### Example

```js
 ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE( [{“productname2”:“Laptop”,“quantity1”:101}])
```

returns

```json
 [{"productname2":"Laptop","quantity1":101}]
```

### Concept

Now let us take an example to insert data into a MySQL database from the form. There would be multiple rows of data to be inserted using the Form repeat control. The form repeat control will return JSON type of output. So the data sent to the insert statement would be as JSON data containing the double-quotes.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/escape-single-quote-sql-query.png" alt="SQL Query" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>SQL  Query</i></figcaption>
</figure>

In this case that may lead to an error in the Insert query.

Thus we will use the Compute task to escape or ignore the double-quotes.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/escape-double-quote-compute.png" alt="ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE Fx Configured" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE Fx Configured</i></figcaption>
</figure>



Now for the Insert query for MySQL database, the Product name thus derived would be sent as a dynamic value. In this example, the Price is also a dynamic value for the repeated rows.

The connector would be configured as seen below with the Insert query fields passed accordingly.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/escape-double-quote-config.png" alt="ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE Output Used in Connector Call" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE Output Used in Connector Call</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Now if you add a Popup Task to check what values are inserted using the ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE() function, you can see the variable values as follows:

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/escape-double-quote-output.png" alt="ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE Output" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>ESCAPEDOUBLEQUOTE Output</i></figcaption>
</figure>

You can see that the data has been entered properly with no error by ignoring the double-quotes.

## ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE

The `ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE` function helps you to ignore the single quotes that are typically present in data that you want to insert in SQL or any relational database.

### Definition

```js
 ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE(string / json field)
 ```

Where,

*  `<string/json>`: is the column or field value that contains the single quote symbol


### Example

```js
 ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE ([{“productname2”:“Welch’s Fruit Snacks”,“price”:20}] )
 ```

returns
```json
[{"productname2":"Welch\'s Fruit Snacks","price":20}] 
```

### Concept

The `ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE` function helps you to ignore the single quotes that are typically present in strings where a single quote or an apostrophe is an integral part of the data. For example in an Author table in a MySQL there can be Names like O'Reilly that would have a single quote as an integral part. When you are inserting the name using an insert query then it may lead to some errors. In such cases, the ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE would allow the single quote symbol to be ignored and used as a part of the string and not a special character.

Now let us take an example to insert data into a MySQL database from a Product details form. Say you are adding the Product name, which may contain single quote data or which may contain the apostrophe symbol.


<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/escape-single-quote-sql-query.png" alt="SQL Query" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>SQL  Query</i></figcaption>
</figure>

In such cases, we can use the compute block and add the respective columns to ignore the single quote from the data and use it as a part of the string using the ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE function.

Considering that we are adding a product name ‘ Hershey's chocolate syrup ‘ which contains an “ apostrophe s ”, when inserting into the database it will be taken as [{"productname2":"Hershey's chocolate syrup","price":20}] which may cause a problem in the insert statement due to the single quote which interferes with the query statement. So here in a Compute block if you add the function to ignore the single quote as

```js
ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE( formrepeat)
```

the output would be

```json
[{"productname2":"Hershey\'s chocolate syrup","price":20}]
```

which would be a valid format to insert to the MySQL database or any SQL in use.

Thus you can make use of the ESCAPESINGLEQUOTE() function that would enable you to ignore the single quote as a part of the code.

## STRINGENCODE

The `STRINGENCODE` enables you to accept a String as input and returns an Encoded string value for the same.

### Definition

```js
 STRINGENCODE(StringInput)
```

Where,

 * `StringInput:` Is the String that is to be encoded

### Example

```js
 STRINGENCODE("Welcome to DronaHQ!%")
```

returns
> Welcome%20to%20DronaHQ!%25

### Concept

Now if you take an example here to send a WhatsApp message using your custom App and want to pass a string with special characters then in that case you encode the WhatsApp Message string using STRINGENCODE function.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/string-encode-configure.jpg" alt="STRINGENCODE Configure" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>STRINGENCODE Configure</i></figcaption>
</figure>


The output of the same would be something like this in the image below.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/fx-formulas/string-encode-result.jpg" alt="STRINGENCODE Result" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>STRINGENCODE Result</i></figcaption>
</figure> 



You can thus make use of the StringEncode function to encode and securely send data across networks.
